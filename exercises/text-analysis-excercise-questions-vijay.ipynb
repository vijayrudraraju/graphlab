        "['autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations or by rare combinations of common genetic variants the prevalence of autism is about 12 per 1000 people worldwide however the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reports an approximate of 9 per 1000 children in the united states are diagnosed with asd parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their childs life autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood  autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name  autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express oneself such as the deficiency to point at things  most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than nonautistic children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition children with highfunctioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to nonautistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone  making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism  for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel  functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums a 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with asd and reported that about twothirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about onethird had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in nonautistic children with language impairments about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs  differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver  in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words  autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointedat object in a pair of studies highfunctioning autistic children aged 815 performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling  both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference  as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scalerevised rbsr no single repetitive or selfinjurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated 05 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants  many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders  differences are greater for underresponsivity for example walking into things than for overresponsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking unusual eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator  selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition  although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal gi symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different gi symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gi problems and asd is unclear parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress  siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children or those with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pddnos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder  unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism  in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairmentswho may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rockingto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication  because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial  autism can also be divided into syndromal and nonsyndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis  although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and nonsyndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics  newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression  studies of twins suggest that heritability is 07 for autism and as high as 09 for asd and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population  hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism  gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activitydependent changes  all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development  although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines although no links have been found and some have been completely disproven  parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination and this has given rise to theories that vaccines or their preservatives cause autism which was fueled by a scientific study which has since been proven to have been falsified  although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible autisms symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain  how autism occurs is not well understood  its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinsons autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms  autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product  neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception  just after birth the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response it is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of asd although some abnormalities in the immune system have been found in specific subgroups of autistic individuals it is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to or secondary to autisms disease processes  as autoantibodies are found in conditions other than asd and are not always present in asd the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones other data argue for diminished growth factors  also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5 of cases the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autisms core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individuals understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions asdrelated patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a largescale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the taskpositive network used in sustained attention and goaldirected thinking  in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of selfreferential thought a 2008 brainimaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with asd the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning highlevel neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of lowlevel processes  evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex  other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex from studies based on eventrelated potentials transient changes to the brains electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli  for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brains processing of auditory signals in the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q211 deletion syndrome   research on autismschizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 15q133 chromosome 16 16p131 and chromosome 17 17p12 are inconclusive two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition the empathizingsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemizethat is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brainbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing these theories are somewhat related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic childrens atypical responses to the sallyanne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing  executive dysfunction hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in working memory planning inhibition and other forms of executive function a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism  one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people a related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals  these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful about half of parents of children with asd notice their childs unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about fourfifths notice by age 24 months us and japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months using autismspecific formal screening tests  in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective  screening tools designed for one cultures norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture  although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism  autism is defined in the dsmivtr as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior  sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects  onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder  icd10 uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available  two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interviewrevised adir is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider mental retardation hearing impairment and a specific language impairment the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to highresolution chromosome and fragile x testing   as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge  commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autisms genetics  metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a oneyearold who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a threeyearold to continue to do so a few years later  in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice a 2009 us study found the average age of formal asd diagnosis was 57 years far above recommendations and that 27 of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years  although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms  conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence  no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the childs needs  although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options  intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire selfcare social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated  available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy educational interventions have some effectiveness in children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is wellestablished for improving intellectual performance of young children the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails  more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics  aside from antipsychotics there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so  for someone born in 2000 a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of 9 net present value in 2010 dollars inflationadjusted from 2003 estimateus with about 10 medical care 30 extra education and other care and 60 lost economic productivity  publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed outofpocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one 2008 us study found a 14 average loss of annual income in families of children with asd and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment  us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance  after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning no cure is known  most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years  most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or selfdetermination  although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age  acquiring language before age six having an iq above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism a 2004 british study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with iq above 50 found that 12 achieved a high level of independence as adults 10 had some friends and were generally in work but required some support 19 had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living 46 needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in asd with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and 12 needed highlevel hospital care a 2005 swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low iq found worse prognosis for example only 4 achieved independence a 2008 canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with asd as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor 46 fair 32 good 17 and very good 4 56 of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or parttime work  changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 12 per 1000 for autism and close to 6 per 1000 for asd because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asds true prevalence  pddnoss prevalence has been estimated at 37 per 1000 asperger syndrome at roughly 06 per 1000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 002 per 1000  the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s  this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autisms true prevalence has increased boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages 431 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 21 with mental retardation and more than 551 without the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a 12yearold boy who may have been severely autistic  luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest welldocumented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blairs marriage to gain blairs inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in 1798 showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word auts  meaning self and used it to mean morbid selfadmiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology  asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981  almost all the characteristics described in kanners first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to refrigerator mothers  starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy  as late as the mid1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions  although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely  sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being', 'agriculture agriculture encompasses a wide variety of specialties and techniques including ways to expand the lands suitable for plant raising by digging waterchannels and other forms of irrigation  cultivation of crops on arable land and the pastoral herding of livestock on rangeland remain at the foundation of agriculture  in the past century there has been increasing concern to identify and quantify various forms of agriculture  in the developed world the range usually extends between sustainable agriculture eg permaculture or organic agriculture and intensive farming eg industrial agriculture modern agronomy plant breeding pesticides and fertilizers and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects  selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry such as intensive pig farming and similar practices applied to the chicken have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal cruelty and the health effects of the antibiotics growth hormones and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials  in the 21st century plants have been used to grow biofuels biopharmaceuticals bioplastics in 2007 one third of the worlds workers were employed in agriculture the services sector has overtaken agriculture as the economic sector employing the most people worldwide  despite the size of its workforce agricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the gross world product an aggregate of all gross domestic products the word agriculture is the english adaptation of latin agricultra from ager a field and cultra cultivation in the strict sense of tillage of the soil  thus a literal reading of the word yields tillage of a field  of fields agriculture has played a key role in the development of human civilization  until the industrial revolution the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture  development of agricultural techniques has steadily increased agricultural productivity and the widespread diffusion of these techniques during a time period is often called an agricultural revolution a remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies  in particular the haberbosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate made the traditional practice of recycling nutrients with crop rotation and animal manure less necessary synthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century  increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well  further global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when highyield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn maize were introduced as a part of the green revolution the green revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world  thomas malthus famously predicted that the earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the green revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food many governments have subsidized agriculture to ensure an adequate food supply  these agricultural subsidies are often linked to the production of certain commodities such as wheat corn maize rice soybeans and milk  these subsidies especially when instituted by developed countries have been noted as protectionist inefficient and environmentally damaging in the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides selective breeding mechanization water contamination and farm subsidies  proponents of organic farming such as sir albert howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the longterm fertility of the soil  while this feeling lay dormant for decades as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers consumers and policymakers in recent years there has been a backlash against perceived external environmental effects of mainstream agriculture particularly regarding water pollution resulting in the organic movement  one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in 2005 to phase out commoditylinked farm subsidies also known as decoupling the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management and selective breeding  recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food in late 2007 several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle causing higher prices of wheat up 58 soybean up 32 and maize up 11 over the year an epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by race ug99 is currently spreading across africa and into asia and is causing major concern agricultural practices such as irrigation crop rotation fertilizers and pesticides were developed long ago but have made great strides in the past century the history of agriculture has played a major role in human history as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide socioeconomic change  division of labor in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in huntergatherer cultures  so too are arts such as epic literature and monumental architecture as well as codified legal systems  when farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition  historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible the fertile crescent of western asia egypt and india were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild  independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern china africas sahel new guinea and several regions of the americas the eight socalled neolithic founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer wheat and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax by 7000bc smallscale agriculture reached egypt from at least 7000bc the indian subcontinent saw farming of wheat and barley as attested by archaeological excavation at mehrgarh in balochistan in what is present day pakistan by 6000bc midscale farming was entrenched on the banks of the nile this as irrigation had not yet matured sufficiently  about this time agriculture was developed independently in the far east with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop  chinese and indonesian farmers went on to domesticate taro and beans including mung soy and azuki  to complement these new sources of carbohydrates highly organized net fishing of rivers lakes and ocean shores in these areas brought in great volumes of essential protein  collectively these new methods of farming and fishing inaugurated a human population boom that dwarfed all previous expansions and continues today by 5000bc the sumerians had developed core agricultural techniques including largescale intensive cultivation of land monocropping organized irrigation and the use of a specialized labor force particularly along the waterway now known as the shatt alarab from its persian gulf delta to the confluence of the tigris and euphrates domestication of wild aurochs and mouflon into cattle and sheep respectively ushered in the largescale use of animals for foodfiber and as beasts of burden the shepherd joined the farmer as an essential provider for sedentary and seminomadic societies  maize manioc and arrowroot were first domesticated in the americas as far back as 5200bc the potato tomato pepper squash several varieties of bean tobacco and several other plants were also developed in the americas as was extensive terracing of steep hillsides in much of andean south america the greeks and romans built on techniques pioneered by the sumerians but made few fundamentally new advances  southern greeks struggled with very poor soils yet managed to become a dominant society for years the romans were noted for an emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade in the same region a parallel agricultural revolution occurred resulting in some of the most important crops grown today  in mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize more than 6000 years ago it gradually spread across north america and was the major crop of native americans at the time of european exploration  other mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of squash and beans  cocoa was also a major crop in domesticated mexico and central america the turkey one of the most important meat birds was probably domesticated in mexico or the us southwest in the andes region of south america the major domesticated crop was potatoes domesticated perhaps 5000 years ago  large varieties of beans were domesticated in south america as well as animals including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs  coca still a major crop was also domesticated in the andes a minor center of domestication the indigenous people of the eastern us appear to have domesticated numerous crops  sunflowers tobacco varieties of squash and chenopodium as well as crops no longer grown including marshelder and little barley were domesticated  other wild foods may have undergone some selective cultivation including wild rice and maple sugar the most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from eastern north america by 3500 bc the simplest form of the plough was developed called the ard  before this period simple digging sticks or hoes were used  these tools would have also been easier to transport which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soils nutrients were depleted  however through excavations in mexico it has been found that the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land would also have been a sustaining practice  additional research in central europe later revealed that agriculture was indeed practiced at this method  for this method ards were thus much more efficient than digging sticks during the middle ages farmers in north africa the near east and europe began making use of agricultural technologies including irrigation systems based on hydraulic and hydrostatic principles machines such as norias waterraising machines dams and reservoirs  this combined with the invention of a threefield system of crop rotation and the moldboard plow greatly improved agricultural efficiency in the european medieval period agriculture was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts after 1492 a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred  key crops involved in this exchange included the tomato maize potato manioc cocoa bean and tobacco going from the new world to the old and several varieties of wheat spices coffee and sugar cane going from the old world to the new the most important animal exportation from the old world to the new were those of the horse and dog dogs were already present in the precolumbian americas but not in the numbers and breeds suited to farm work  although not usually food animals the horse including donkeys and ponies and dog quickly filled essential production roles on westernhemisphere farms the potato became an important staple crop in northern europe since being introduced by portuguese in the 16th century maize and manioc have replaced traditional african crops as the continents most important staple food crops by the early 19th century agricultural techniques implements seed stocks and cultivated plants selected and given a unique name because of its decorative or useful characteristics had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages although there is a vast and interesting history of crop cultivation before the dawn of the 20th century there is little question that the work of charles darwin and gregor mendel created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years with the rapid rise of mechanization in the late 19th century and the 20th century particularly in the form of the tractor farming tasks could be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible  these advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the united states argentina israel germany and a few other nations to output volumes of highquality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit the haberbosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints  in the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity the substitution of labor for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides water pollution and farm subsidies  in recent years there has been a backlash against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic movement the cereals rice corn and wheat provide 60 of human food supply  for example irrigation increased corn yields in eastern colorado by 400 to 500 from 1940 to 1997 however concerns have been raised over the sustainability of intensive agriculture  intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in india and asia and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment particularly as population increases and food demand expands the monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests which are controlled through pesticides  integrated pest management ipm which has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and ipm is knowledgeintensive although the green revolution significantly increased rice yields in asia yield increases have not occurred in the past 1520 years the genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966 and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in 35 years agricultural exploration expeditions since the late 19th century have been mounted to find new species and new agricultural practices in different areas of the world  two early examples of expeditions include frank n meyers fruit and nutcollecting trip to china and japan from 19161918 in 2009 the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states according to the international monetary fund see below  economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly 26 times more productive than it was in 1948 six countries  the us canada france australia argentina and thailand  supply 90 of grain exports the united states controls almost half of world grain exports may soon do the same in larger countries such as china or india cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer  shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 1020  this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control  annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period  this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs further industrialization lead to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage  because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers in tropical environments all of these cropping systems are practiced  in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation  in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry  in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system the last century has seen the intensification concentration and specialization of agriculture relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals fertilizers and pesticides mechanization and plant breeding hybrids and gmos  in the past few decades a move towards sustainability in agriculture has also developed integrating ideas of socioeconomic justice and conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system  this has led to the development of many responses to the conventional agriculture approach including organic agriculture urban agriculture community supported agriculture ecological or biological agriculture integrated farming and holistic management as well as an increased trend towards agricultural diversification important categories of crops include grains and pseudograins pulses legumes forage and fruits and vegetables specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world  in millions of metric tons based on fao estimate animals including horses mules oxen camels llamas alpacas and dogs are often used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers  animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products like milk eggs or wool on a continual basis but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grassland  based mixed and landless grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals  outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source  this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing 3040 million pastoralists landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the delinking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in oecd member countries  in the us 70 of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots in the united states food costs attributed to processing distribution and marketing have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined  this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition eg more highly processed products provided by the supply chain  from 1960 to 1980 the farm share was around 40 but by 1990 it had declined to 30 and by 1998 222  market concentration has increased in the sector as well with the top 20 food manufacturers accounting for half the foodprocessing value in 1995 over double that produced in 1954  as of 2000 the top six us supermarket groups had 50 of sales compared to 32 in 1992  although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization  altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic makeup of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds droughttolerance or resistance to pests  significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel his work on dominant and recessive alleles gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and brought great insights to the techniques utilized by plant breeders  crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits selfpollination and crosspollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants  careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants  plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand extensive xray an ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie primitive genetic engineering during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield many folds by creating highyielding varieties for example average yields of corn maize in the usa have increased from around 25 tons per hectare tha 40 bushels per acre in 1900 to about 94 tha 150 bushels per acre in 2001  similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 tha in 1900 to more than 25 tha in 1990  south american average wheat yields are around 2 tha african under 1 tha egypt and arabia up to 35 to 4 tha with irrigation  in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 tha  variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology  genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops  after mechanical tomatoharvesters were developed in the early 1960s agricultural scientists genetically modified tomatoes to be more resistant to mechanical handling  more recently genetic engineering is being employed in various parts of the world to create crops with other beneficial traits roundup ready seed has a herbicide resistant gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate  roundup is a trade name for a glyphosatebased product which is a systemic nonselective herbicide used to kill weeds  roundup ready seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with glyphosate to control weeds without harming the resistant crop  herbicidetolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide  today 92 of soybean acreage in the us is planted with genetically modified herbicidetolerant plants with the increasing use of herbicidetolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosatebased herbicide sprays  in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications other gmo crops used by growers include insectresistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects  these crops protect plants from damage by insects one such crop is starlink another is cotton which accounts for 63 of us cotton acreage some believe that similar or better pestresistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or crosspollination with wild species  in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least nineteen diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes genetic engineers may someday develop transgenic plants which would allow for irrigation drainage conservation sanitary engineering and maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil fuel derived inputs than conventional crops  such developments would be particularly important in areas which are normally arid and rely upon constant irrigation and on large scale farms however genetic engineering of plants has proven to be controversial  many issues surrounding food security and environmental impacts have risen regarding gmo practices  for example gmos are questioned by some ecologists and economists concerned with gmo practices such as terminator seeds another controversial issue is the patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering  since companies have intellectual ownership of their seeds they have the power to dictate terms and conditions of their patented product  currently ten seed companies control over twothirds of the global seed sales  vandana shiva argues that these companies are guilty of biopiracy by patenting life and exploiting organisms for profit farmers using patented seed are restricted from saving seed for subsequent plantings which forces farmers to buy new seed every year  since seed saving is a traditional practice for many farmers in both developing and developed countries gmo seeds legally bind farmers to change their seed saving practices to buying new seed every year locally adapted seeds are an essential heritage that has the potential to be lost with current hybridized crops and gmos locally adapted seeds also called land races or crop ecotypes are important because they have adapted over time to the specific microclimates soils other environmental conditions field designs and ethnic preference indigenous to the exact area of cultivation  introducing gmos and hybridized commercial seed to an area brings the risk of crosspollination with local land races therefore gmos pose a threat to the sustainability of land races and the ethnic heritage of cultures  once seed contains transgenic material it becomes subject to the conditions of the seed company that owns the patent of the transgenic material modern agriculture is a term used to describe the wide majority of production practices employed by americas farmers the term depicts the push for innovation stewardship and advancements continually made by growers to sustainably produce higherquality products with a reduced environmental impact  intensive scientific research and robust investment in modern agriculture during the past 50 years has helped farmers double food production while essentially freezing the footprint of total cultivated farmland the agriculture industry works with government agencies and other organizations to ensure that farmers have access to the technologies required to support modern agriculture practices  farmers are supported by education and certification programs that ensure they apply agricultural practices with care and only when required technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to help reduce their environmental footprint and to make farming more sustainable new technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration the world bank the bill  melinda gates foundation and others have noted that integrated crop management is based on agroecological principles and can increase yields while reducing environmental damage the goal of modern agriculture practices is to help farmers provide an affordable supply of food to meet the demands of a growing population  with modern agriculture more crops can be grown on less land allowing farmers to provide an increased supply of food at an affordable price food security issues also coincide with food safety and food labeling concerns  currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled whereas the us does not require transparent labeling of gmo foods  since there are still questions regarding the safety and risks associated with gmo foods some believe the public should have the freedom to choose and know what they are eating and require all gmo products to be labeled the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a neutral forum where nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate food policy and the regulation of agriculture  according to dr samuel jutzi director of faos animal production and health division lobbying by powerful big food corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment the real true issues are not being addressed by the political process because of the influence of lobbyists of the true powerful entities he said speaking at the compassion in world farming annual forum  for example recent proposals for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without longterm damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure agriculture imposes external costs upon society through pesticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and assorted other problems a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of 2343 million or 208 per hectare a key player who is credited to saving billions of lives because of his revolutionary work in developing new agricultural techniques is norman borlaug his transformative work brought highyield crop varieties to developing countries and earned him an unofficial title as the father of the green revolution a senior un official and coauthor of a un report detailing this problem henning steinfeld said livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems  livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture or 30 of the land surface of the planet it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents  by comparison all transportation emits 135 of the co2 it produces 65 of humanrelated nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2 and 37 of all humaninduced methane which is 23 times as warming as co2 it also generates 64 of the ammonia which contributes to acid rain and acidification of ecosystems  livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops  through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity  estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 3950  land degradation the longterm decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on 24 of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented the unfao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 15 billion people rely upon the degrading land  degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation acidification and salinization eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses  excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land  these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 25 million tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant the world health organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing 220000 deaths  pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website  growing more per acre leaves more land for nature  however critics argue that a tradeoff between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature rainfall timing and quantity co2 solar radiation and the interaction of these elements  agriculture can both mitigate or worsen global warming some of the increase in co2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddies  further wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification releasing the greenhouse gas nitric oxide  changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases and soil can further be used to sequester some of the co2 in the atmosphere differences in economic development population density and culture mean that the farmers of the world operate under very different conditions a us

compensated with public subsidies the latter compensates absence of subsidies with economics of scale and low cost of land in the peoples republic of china a rural households productive asset may be one hectare of farmland in brazil paraguay and other countries where local legislature allows such purchases international investors buy thousands of hectares of farmland or raw land at prices of a few hundred us per hectare below is a list of countries by agricultural output in 2009  output is in millions of us since the 1940s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energyintensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources  between 1950 and 1984 the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing by 250 as world population doubled  modern agricultures heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output causing food shortages modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways 1 direct consumption on the farm and 2 indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm  direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery and use of gas liquid propane and electricity to power dryers pumps lights heaters and coolers  american farms directly consumed about 12 exajoules 11 quadrillion btu in 2002 or just over 1 percent of the nations total energy indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides which accounted for 06 exajoules 06 quadrillion btu in 2002 food systems encompass not just agricultural production but also offfarm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and foodrelated items  agriculture accounts for less than onefifth of food system energy use in the united states oil shortages could impact this food supply some farmers using modern organicfarming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming without the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides  however the reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques made possible by petroleumbased technology takes time in 2007 higher incentives for farmers to grow nonfood biofuel crops combined with other factors such as overdevelopment of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth to cause food shortages in asia the middle east africa and mexico as well as rising food prices around the globe  as of december 2007 37 countries faced food crises and 20 had imposed some sort of foodprice controls some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes the biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the haberbosch fertilizercreation process  natural gas is used because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen  when oil production becomes so scarce that natural gas is used as a partial stopgap replacement and hydrogen use in transportation increases natural gas will become much more expensive if the haber process is unable to be commercialized using renewable energy such as by electrolysis or if other sources of hydrogen are not available to replace the haber process in amounts sufficient to supply transportation and agricultural needs this major source of fertilizer would either become extremely expensive or unavailable  this would either cause food shortages or dramatic rises in food prices one effect oil shortages could have on agriculture is a full return to organic agriculture  in light of peakoil concerns organic methods are more sustainable than contemporary practices because they use no petroleumbased pesticides herbicides or fertilizers some farmers using modern organicfarming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming it has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer some fuel and food instead of the normal food vs fuel debate  as the synfuel would be used onsite the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organicagriculture fusion it has been suggested that some transgenic plants may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossilfuelderived inputs than conventional crops while there has been some research on sustainability using gmo crops at least one hyped and prominent multiyear attempt by monsanto company has been unsuccessful though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop nevertheless some governments in africa continue to view investments in new transgenic technologies as an essential component of efforts to improve sustainability agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production  at the policy level common goals of agriculture include', 'articlesofconfederation the articles of confederation were the first constitution of the united states and specified how the federal government was to operate including adoption of an official name for the new nation united states of america the second continental congress appointed a committee to draft the articles in june 1776 and sent the draft to the states for ratification in november 1777  in practice the articles were in use beginning in 1777   the ratification process was completed in march 1781  under the articles the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government on june 12 1776 a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the declaration of independence the second continental congress resolved to appoint a committee of thirteen to prepare a draft of a constitution for a confederate type of union the last draft of the articles was written in the summer of 1777 and the second continental congress approved them for ratification by the states on november 15 1777 after a year of debate  in practice the final draft of the articles served as the de facto system of government used by the congress the united states in congress assembled until it became de jure by final ratification on march 1 1781 at which point congress became the congress of the confederation the articles set the rules for operations of the united states government it was capable of making war negotiating diplomatic agreements and resolving issues regarding the western territories  article xiii stipulated that their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state and the union shall be perpetual the articles were created by the representatives of the states in the second continental congress out of a perceived need to have a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom sovereignty and independence of the united states nationalists felt that the articles lacked the necessary requirements for an effective government  there was no tax base no executive agencies or judiciary the absence of tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years   in 1788 with the approval of congress the articles were replaced by the united states constitution and the new government began operations in 1789 the political push for the colonies to increase cooperation began with the albany congress in 1754 when benjamin franklin proposed an intercolonial collaboration that resembled the articles starting in 1775 the second continental congress acted as the provisional national government that ran the american revolutionary war it was an era of constitution writingmost states were busy at the taskand leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution even though they were uncommon in other nations  meanwhile congress exercised an unprecedented level of political diplomatic military and economic authority over the colonies it adopted commercial codes established and maintained an army and selected its generals issued money created a military code of law defined crimes and negotiated with foreign governments congress began to move for ratification of the articles of confederation in 1777 the document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all thirteen colonies the first state to ratify was virginia on december 16 1777 even though the articles of confederation and the constitution were established by many of the same people the two documents are very different the original fivepage articles contained a preamble thirteen articles a conclusion and a signatory section the preamble states that the signatory states agree to certain articles of confederation and perpetual union between the 13 states the former british colonies the following list contains short summaries of each of the thirteen articles while still at war with great britain the founding fathers were divided between those seeking a powerful centralized national government and those seeking a loosely structured one  jealously guarding their new independence members of the continental congress arrived at a compromise solution dividing sovereignty between the states and the federal government with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states  while calling on congress to regulate military and monetary affairs for example the articles of confederation provided no mechanism with which to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or revenue  at times this left the military in a precarious position as george washington wrote in a letter in 1781 to the governor of massachusetts john hancock the treaty of paris 1783 which ended hostilities with great britain languished in congress for months because several state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature to ratify it  yet congress had no power to enforce attendance  writing to george clinton in september 1783 george washington complained the articles supported the congressional direction of the continental army and allowed the 13 states to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers  as a tool to build a centralized warmaking government they were largely a failure  historian bruce chadwick wrote the continental congress before the articles were approved had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life   however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor  no progress was made in congress during the winter of 1783  84  general henry knox who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army the army had long been supportive of a strong union   knox wrote as congress failed to act on the petitions knox wrote to gouverneur morris four years before the philadelphia convention was convened as the present constitution is so defective why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so that is to have a convention of the states to form a better constitution once the war had been won the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks  meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and 11 of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met  in 1783 george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states  any contributions were voluntary and in the debates of 1788 the federalists who supported the proposed new constitution claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally and contributed when the continental army protected their states interests the antifederalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs  dougherty 2009 concludes that generally the states behavior validated the federalist analysis  this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms even after peace had been achieved in 1783 the weakness of the confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy  in 1786 thomas jefferson concerned over the failure to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates wrote to james monroe it will be said there is no money in the treasury  there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth the states must see the rod  also the jaygardoqui treaty with spain in 1786 also showed weakness in foreign policy  in this treaty  which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity  the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for 30 years which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains finally due to the confederations military weakness it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil  forts which the british promised to leave in 1783  this violation of the treaty of paris 1783 was corrected by jays treaty in 1795 under the new us constitution under the articles of confederation the confederation congress could make decisions but it had no power to enforce any of them  this was important because this made it so that the union had no liable source of income   there was a requirement for unanimous approval before any modifications could be made to the articles because the majority of lawmaking authority rested with the states the central government was kept quite limited congress had been denied any powers of taxation it could only request money from the states the states did not generally comply with the requests in full leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money  as more money was printed by congress the continental dollars depreciated  in 1779 george washington wrote to john jay who was serving as the president of the continental congress that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions  mr jay and the congress responded in may by requesting 45 million from the states in an appeal to the states to comply jay wrote that the taxes were the price of liberty the peace and the safety of yourselves and posterity he argued that americans should avoid having it said that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and as a result all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies as well the states and the confederation congress had both incurred debts during the revolutionary war and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the war some states paid off their war debts  however the federalists favored the federal assumption of the states war debts while their opponents opposed it nevertheless the confederation congress did take two actions with longlasting impact the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government set up protocols for the admission of new states the division of land into useful units and set aside land in each township for public use   this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization as in europe and provided the basis for the rest of american continental expansion through the 19th century the land ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river the northwest ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims organized the northwest territory and thus cleared the way for the entry of five new states and part of the sixth to the union the northwest ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery  new states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states to be specific these states gave up all of their claims to land north of the ohio river and west of the present western border of pennsylvania massachusetts connecticut new york pennsylvania and virginia from this land over several decades were formed the new states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin and the part of minnesota east of the mississippi river by the land ordinance of 1785 these were surveyed into the nowfamiliar squares of land called the township 36 square miles the section one square mile and the quarter section 160 acres  this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire then when the homestead act was enacted in 1867 the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settlerfarmers the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure the articles envisioned  a permanent confederation but granted to the congressthe only federal institutionlittle power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced   there was no president and no national court the articles of confederation were weak and did not give a strong political or economic base for the newly formed nation although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fastgrowing nation together they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control by 1783 with the end of the british blockade the new nation was regaining its prosperity  however trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships  france and spain established similar policies   simultaneously new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again   political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations debts incurred during the war or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development only aggravated a gloomy situation   in 178687 the shays rebellion an uprising of farmers in western massachusetts against the state court system threatened the stability of state government the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency spawning the expression not worth a continental   congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone when adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce   demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty   adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws   meanwhile each state acted individually against great britain to little effect   when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports by 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping   state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit   land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population the idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor   alexander hamilton realized while serving as washingtons top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress hamilton led a group of likeminded nationalists won washingtons endorsement and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the longterm crisis the second continental congress approved the articles for distribution to the states on november 15 1777  a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and a cover letter had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress the articles however were unsigned and the date was blank  congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june 27 1778  they ordered a final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification on july 9 1778 the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed  on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified  new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified  north carolina and georgia also didnt sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended  for example john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august 8  john penn was the first of north carolinas delegates to arrive on july 10 and the delegation signed the articles on july 21 1778 the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation  georgia signed on july 24 new jersey on november 26 and delaware on february 12 1779  maryland refused to ratify the articles until every state had ceded its western land claims on february 2 1781 the muchawaited decision was taken by the maryland general assembly in annapolis as the last piece of business during the afternoon session among engrossed bills was signed and sealed by governor thomas sim lee in the senate chamber in the presence of the members of both houses an act to empower the delegates of this state in congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation and perpetual union among the states the senate then adjourned to the first monday in august next the decision of maryland to ratify the articles was reported to the continental congress on february 12  the formal signing of the articles by the maryland delegates took place in philadelphia at noon time on march 1 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon  with these events the articles entered into force and the united states came into being as a united sovereign and national state congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years  many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates and some of the signers had only recently arrived the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time the signers and the states they represented were roger sherman connecticut was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the united states the continental association the united states declaration of independence the articles of confederation and the united states constitution robert morris pennsylvania was the only person besides sherman to sign three of the great state papers of the united states the united states declaration of independence the articles of confederation and the united states constitution john dickinson delaware daniel carroll maryland and gouverneur morris new york along with sherman and robert morris were the only five people to sign both the articles of confederation and the united states constitution gouverneur morris represented pennsylvania when signing the constitution the following list is of those who led the congress of the confederation under the articles of confederation as the presidents of the united states in congress assembled under the articles the president was the presiding officer of congress chaired the cabinet the committee of the states when congress was in recess and performed other administrative functions he was not however an executive in the way the successor president of the united states is a chief executive since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of congress in may 1786 charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries  unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states especially after shays rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts on january 21 1786 the virginia legislature following james madisons recommendation invited all the states to send delegates to annapolis maryland to discuss ways to reduce these interstate conflicts  at what came to be known as the annapolis convention the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in philadelphia in may 1787 to discuss ways to improve the articles of confederation in a grand convention although the states representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles the representatives held secret closeddoor sessions and wrote a new constitution the new constitution gave much more power to the central government but characterization of the result is disputed the general goal of the authors was to get as close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships  historian forrest mcdonald using the ideas of james madison from federalist 39 describes the change this way when approached after leaving the close of the federal convention benjamin franklin was asked a question  this is the conversation as has been recorded the lady asked well doctor what have we gota republic or a monarchy historian ralph ketcham comments on the opinions of patrick henry george mason and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution according to their own terms for modification article xiii the articles would still have been in effect until 1790 the year in which the last of the 13 states ratified the new constitution the congress under the articles continued to sit until november 1788 historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787  jillson and wilson 1994 point to the financial weakness as well as the norms rules and institutional structures of the congress and the propensity to divide along sectional lines rakove 1988 identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes mustering men and gathering supplies from a warweary populace the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after 1783 especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy  finally the confederations lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power when the war ended in 1783 certain special interests had incentives to create a new merchant state much like the british state people had rebelled against  in particular holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims  also manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods but competition among states made this impossible without a central government political scientist david c hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the confederation john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states to which the states gave their voluntary consent and until those obligations were fulfilled neither nullification of the authority of congress exercising its due powers nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges', 'asparagales the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of dna sequence analysis but is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse  thus although most species in the order are herbaceous some no more than 15cm high there are a number of climbers eg some species of asparagus as well as several genera forming trees eg  agave cordyline yucca dracaena some of which can exceed 10 m in height  succulent genera occur in several families eg  aloe one of the defining characteristics of the order is the presence of phytomelan a black pigment present in the seed coat creating a dark crust  phytomelan is found in most families of the asparagales although not in orchidaceae thought to be a sister to the rest of the group almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves a rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of a moreorless woody stem the leaves are less often produced along the stem the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive being of a general lily type with six tepals either free or fused from the base the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some 120130 million years ago early in the cretaceous period although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved estimates are likely to be uncertain from an economic point of view the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order poales which includes grasses and cereals  species are used as food and flavourings eg onion garlic leek asparagus vanilla as cut flowers eg freesia gladiolus iris orchids and as garden ornamentals eg day lilies lily of the valley agapanthus most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials although some are climbers eg species of asparagus family asparagaceae and some are treelike the order also contains many geophytes bulbs corms and various kinds of tuber  almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves  a rosette at the base of the plant or in the treeforming species at the end of a woody stem  only in a few cases are leaves produced along the length of the stem the flowers are often at the tip of the stem and are mainly of a rather generalized lily type with six tepals and up to six stamens the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize  no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales the taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by kubitzki uptodate information on the asparagales can be found on the angiosperm phylogeny website the families of the asparagales as set out in the apg iii system are briefly surveyed below  for more information follow the links to the main articles the orchid family is one of the two largest families of angiosperms the other is asteraceae the shape of the flowers is very distinctive making orchids easy to recognize the flower is bilaterally symmetrical the three sepals are generally colourful and bright which is why they are sometimes called outer tepals with one on each side and one usually at the top of the flower sometimes forming a hood the three petals or inner tepals also showy are located alternately between the sepals two at the side and one usually at the bottom of the flower  this last is called the lip and is distinctively different from the side petals the pollination systems of orchids are among the most complex and interesting of all the angiosperms orchids include many species of great ornamental value  vanilla is obtained from the fruit of the orchid vanilla planifolia the genus borya contains treelike species which behave as resurrection plants  growing on rocky slopes the plants dry out during the dry season and become a rusty orange color but quickly turn green and become active again once it starts to rain  along with the other genus in the boryaceae family alania these xerophytic plants are native to australia the asteliaceae is a family of two to four genera of plants found in the southern hemisphere they are more or less rhizomatous with spiral leaves and an inflorescence that may form a raceme or a spike  there are large bracts at the base of the inflorescence the individual flowers are small with tepals joined at the base the family includes some 150 species with a worldwide distribution excluding europe and northern asia species can be recognized by their rosettes of more or less folded leaves with persistent bases and quite prominent nonglandular hairs the tepals in the outer whorl tend to be green on the outside the ovary is inferior with often a thin tubular portion at its apex formed by joined tepals or the tip of the ovary the family includes a single genus ixiolirion with four species distributed from egypt to central asia they are herbs with corms and an inflorescence forming a cluster the individual flowers are blue shortly tubular with an inferior ovary the nine genera are found in chile the united states and africa they are herbs with corms and leaves which are sometimes stalked petiolate with wide blades the flowers have tepals that open outwards the stamens are strongly dimorphic the anthers open by pores the genus cyanastrum is sometimes placed in its own family cyanastraceae the two species of doryanthes the only genus of the family are huge rosetteforming herbs that are a conspicuous element of the flora in the vicinity of sydney australia being hard not to notice when in flower the leaves have entire margins but disintegrate into fibres at the apex the subumbellate inflorescences are borne at the end of long stems having numerous bright red flowers which are radially symmetric with inferior ovaries the iris family contains about 70 genera and over 1600 species with a worldwide distribution members of the family are usually perennial herbs with swordshaped unifacial leaves the inflorescence is a spike or panicle of solitary flowers or forms a monochasial cyme or rhipidium meaning that the successive stems of the flowers follow a zigzag path in the same plane and the flower has only three stamens each opposite to an outer tepal saffron is obtained from the dried styles of crocus sativus l a member of the iris family the corms of some species of iridaceae are used as food by some indigenous peoples many species in the iris family have a great economic importance in ornamental horticulture and the cut flower industry especially gladiolus freesia sparaxis iris tigridia tiger lily ixia corn lily romulea neomarica moraea butterfly lily nemastylis belamcanda sisyrinchium blueeyed grass crocosmia and trimezia many other genera both perennials and bulbs are grown in gardens in tropical and temperate regions eg  watsonia crocus dietes tritonia hesperantha and neomarica the family consists of a single genus xeronema with two species one found only on the poor knights islands in new zealand and the other in new caledonia the inflorescence is crowded with quite large radial symmetrical flowers which face upwards the stamens are strongly exserted ie extend out of the flower the family is still poorly known the xanthorrhoeaceae or grasstree family has been recognized by most taxonomists but the limits of the family have varied greatly  in the narrowest definition the xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto consists only of the genus xanthorrhoea based on phylogenetic research the latest 2009 revision of the apg classification groups together the former families hemerocallidaceae xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto and asphodelaceae as the xanthorrhoeaceae this division has been used here the hemerocallidoideae or day lily subfamily of the xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the hemerocallidaceae it includes perennial herbaceous plants which are glabrous and have short rhizomes with fibrous roots or are rhizomatous with root tubers the leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant and are alternate distichous flat sessile simple linear or lanceolate and parallel veined with entire margins the flower is typically somewhat zygomorphic ie not radially symmetrical and has nectaries the flowers are arranged in various types ofinflorescence the group includes eight genera and about 85 species distributed in the temperate zones of europe and asia malaysia india madagascar africa and the pacific from australia and new zealand to south america two of the genera hemerocallis day lily and phormium new zealand flax are grown as ornamentals worldwide the xanthorrhoeoideae or grasstree subfamily of the xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto it contains only one genus xanthorrhoea endemic to australia many species have an erect woody stem which is covered with persistent dried leaves unless there have been fires topped by a crown of long thin leaves the spikelike inflorescence is erect and densely crowded with small flowers the fruit is a capsule  plants are adapted to bush fires which can stimulate flowering the asphodeloideae or asphodel subfamily of the xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the asphodelaceae members of the family are natives of temperate to tropical regions of the old world with 15 genera and 780 species the greatest diversity occurs in south africa usually in arid habitats they differ from other related families by often being pachycauline ie with a thickened trunk usually wider at the base which has a water storage function by usually having succulent leaves and by possessing a trimerous flower with a superior ovary and seeds with an aryl the most conspicuous genus in the family is aloe many species of aloe are used medicinally and in cosmetics  for example aloin is derived from aloe vera and aloe ferox and has important medical uses eg as a laxative and in the treatment of burns as well as cosmetic uses eg in skin and hair products  other genera are used as ornamental plants both succulents such as aloe haworthia and gasteria and perennials such as kniphofia asphodelus and bulbine the amaryllis family has been recognized in many taxonomic systems but the limits of the family have varied  in the narrowest definition the amaryllidaceae sensu stricto is characterized by an umbellate inflorescence with an inferior ovary  two other groups have similar inflorescences but a superior ovary and have at times been put into separate families the agapanthaceae and the alliaceae based on phylogenetic research the latest 2009 revision of the apg classification groups together these three families under the conserved name of amaryllidaceae a paper published at the same time as the 2009 classification proposed that the original three families should be retained as subfamilies within amaryllidaceae sensu lato the agapanthus subfamily of the amaryllidaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the agapanthaceae the allium subfamily of the amaryllidaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the alliaceae members of the subfamily are found worldwide in temperate subtropical and tropical regions they are herbaceous perennials usually with bulbs although in some cases they have short rhizomes the subfamily can be easily recognized by its characteristic smell the smell of garlic and onions singular enough to be called garlic odour by the very soft fleshy leaves and the umbellike inflorescence at the end of a stem scape which has small to medium flowers with a superior ovary the subfamily is of considerable economic importance being grown as vegetables and seasoning medicinal plants and ornamentals the genus allium includes some of the most widely used edible plants such as onion and shallot varieties of allium cepa garlic a sativum and a scordoprasum leek allium ampeloprasum var porrum and various flavourings such as chives allium schoenoprasum the organosulphur compounds responsible for the characteristic odour are believed to have antioxidant antibiotic and anticarcinogenic properties to stimulate the  immune system and to be protective of liver functioning the family also has important ornamentals mainly from the dominant genus allium but also including genera such as ipheion the amaryllis subfamily of the amaryllidaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the amaryllidaceae sensu stricto the subfamily includes 59 genera and approximately 800 species from temperate and tropical regions worldwide they are herbaceous perennials with bulbs and can be identified by their rather fleshy leaves usually large and attractive flowers with six stamens and an inferior ovary the flowers are solitary or more frequently arranged in umbellate inflorescences at the end of a stem scape many species of amaryllidoideae are popular as ornamentals in parks and gardens a special mention should be made of narcissus daffodils and narcissi cultivated in various parts of the world as an ornamental in gardens and as a cut flower the members of this group have a complex taxonomic history having been assigned to widely differing families in different classification systems  proposed subgroups are difficult to recognise having similar lilylike flowers with the result that some members of the group have been included in different subgroups at different times  based on phylogenetic research the latest 2009 revision of the apg classification supports the use of a single broadly defined family asparagaceae sensu lato the broadly defined family is large with some 153 genera and 2480 species and occurs worldwide the aphyllanthoideae subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the aphyllanthaceae it comprises a single species aphyllanthes monspeliensis found in arid areas of the western mediterranean the inflorescence is made up of small clusters of blue flowers at the end of a long stem scape an unusual feature of the species is that the stem scape is actually the main photosynthetic organ since the paperlike leaves at the base lack chlorophyll the brodiaeoideae subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family under the name themidaceae it comprises about a dozen genera which are native to western north america plants are superficially similar to those of the allium subfamily being perennial herbs with an umbellate inflorescence made up of quite small flowers the tepals are more or less joined at the base sometimes with a corona a structure like the trumpet of a daffodil the ovary is superior  plants lack the garlic odor typical of the allium subfamily and have a fibrous corm rather than a bulb the inflorescence bracts also differ from those of alliums a number of genera including brodiaea and triteleia are grown as ornamental plants the scilloideae or scilla subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family under the name hyacinthaceae the group includes from 770 to 1000 species distributed predominantly in mediterranean climates especially south africa the mediterranean to central asia and burma and south america characteristics of the subfamily include flowers with six tepals and six stamens typically arranged in a raceme a superior ovary growing from bulbs rather fleshy mucilaginous leaves in a basal rosette  plants contain poisonous compounds so that they are not edible many spring and summerflowering bulbs grown in gardens in temperate climates belong to this subfamily including genera such as scilla squill muscari grape hyacinth hyacinthus hyacinthschionodoxa glory of the snow and galtonia summer hyacinth some are used as cut flowers the agavoideae or agave subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family under a variety of names including agavaceae it includes species formerly placed in several other families eg  anthericaceae and hesperocallidaceae many species currently assigned to this group have been placed in other groups at different times  stevens notes the broad concept of agavoideae adopted here may not seem very satisfactory but i fear that none of the alternative solutions is much better given this broad definition there are about 23 genera in over 600 species distributed more or less around the world outside cold areas  south west north america including mexico is an area of particular diversity some members of the subfamily form trees such as the joshua tree a species of yucca they often have large succulent leaves in rosettes either at the base or at the end of the branches  others are herbaceous eg  hosta anthericum the flowers have six tepals and six stamens with either a superior or inferior ovary the lomandroideae subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family laxmanniaceae the group consists of some fifteen genera and about 180 species from australasia south east asia and south america the best known genus is cordyline the tepals of the flower persist in the fruit species of cordyline are grown as house plants and as garden plants in temperate to tropical regions the asparagus subfamily of the amaryllidaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family the asparagaceae sensu stricto the subfamily contains only two genera one asparagus with around 150300 species distributed throughout the old world and a small area of australia the other hemiphylacus with only five species found in mexico the photosynthetic organs of asparagus have been the subject of some controversy however most authors consider them to be flattened stems rather than leaves phylloclades the leaves are reduced to nonphotosynthetic scales with the phylloclades in their axils the flowers are small bellshaped greenishwhite to yellowish with six tepals partially joined together at the base either single or in small clusters springing from the junctions of the phylloclades  asparagus species are usually dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants the fruit is a small red berry which is poisonous to humans the nolinoideae subfamily of the asparagaceae sensu lato is treated in some systems as a separate family under a variety of names including ruscaceae sensu lato  as with the subfamily agavoideae the nolinoideae contains genera previously classified in a number of different families including ruscaceae sensu stricto nolinaceae sensu stricto convallariaceae sensu stricto and eriospermaceae  sensu stricto when broadly defined the group contains some 26 genera and almost 500 species distributed mainly in the temperate to tropical regions of the northern hemisphere there are few morphological features separating the subfamily from other groups within the asparagaceae sensu lato the small flowers are radially symmetrical with six tepals usually joined at the base six stamens and a superior ovary the fruit is usually a berry with few seeds  species vary from herbaceous perennials to treelike forms eg  dracaena there are several examples of convergent evolution between species in this subfamily and those in other subfamilies of the asparagaceae sensu lato  ruscus butchers broom has photosynthetic branches phylloclades similar to those of asparagus asparagoideae dracaena draco has a treelike habit resembling yucca agavoideae and cordyline lomandroideae some genera are used in horticulture  sanseviera and aspidistra are used as house plants in temperate areas and as garden plants in warmer regions polygonatum and ophiopogon are used as garden plants in temperate areas the order asparagales has only recently been recognized in classification systems with the advent of phylogenetics  older systems based on morphology placed many of the species now included in asparagales into the lily family liliaceae where other families were recognized these were generally placed into the old order liliales a very large order which was used for almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm the lilioid monocots the liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups  thus the wettstein system last revised in 1935 did not recognise the asparagales and placed many of the plants involved in an order called liliiflorae the widely used cronquist system of 19681988 also did not recognise asparagales using instead the very broadly defined order liliales the 2009 revision of the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg iii places the order in the clade monocots with the circumscription given below  with this circumscription the order consists of 14 families with approximately 1120 genera and 26000 species order asparagales link the earlier 2003 version apg ii allowed bracketed families ie families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them  these are the families given under including in the list above  apg iii does not allow bracketed families requiring the use of the more comprehensive family otherwise the circumscription of the asparagales is unchanged a separate paper accompanying the publication of the 2009 apg iii system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued the first apg system of 1998 contained some extra families included in square brackets in the list above two other systems which use the order asparagales are the dahlgren system the families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below the equivalent family in the apg iii system is shown in the third column  note that although these systems may use the same name for a family the genera which it includes may be different so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases from the dahlgren system of 1985 onwards studies based mainly on morphology had identified the asparagales as a distinct group but had also included groups now located in liliales pandanales and zingiberales  although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that asparagales may be paraphyletic with orchidaceae separated from the rest  within the monocots asparagales is the sister of the commelinid clade a possible phylogenetic tree for the asparagales including those families recently reduced to subfamilies is shown below the tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group the lower asparagales from orchidaceae to xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato and a wellsupported monophyletic group of core asparagales comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato two differences between these two groups although with exceptions are the mode of microsporogenesis and the position of the ovary the lower asparagales typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis ie cell walls develop only after both meiotic divisions which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots whereas the core asparagales have reverted to successive microsporogenesis ie cell walls develop after each division the lower asparagales typically have an inferior ovary whereas the core asparagales have reverted to a superior ovary a 2002 morphological study by rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the asparagales stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the core asparagales could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries  however stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the lower asparagales in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies the position of the ovary seems a much more more flexible character here and in other angiosperms than previously thought orchidaceae is the largest family of all angiosperms and hence by far the largest in the order the dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids but dna sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined  several studies suggest with high bootstrap support that orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the asparagales other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree generally among the boryaceaehypoxidaceae clade the position of orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries two characters that are typical of the lower asparagales however their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries and most orchids have dustlike seeds untypical of the rest of the order some members of  vanilloideae and cypripedioideaehave crustose seeds probably associated with dispersal by birds and mammals that are attracted by fermenting fleshy fruit releasing fragrant compounds eg vanilla in terms of the number of species orchidaceae diversification is remarkable  however although the other asparagales may be less rich in species they are more variable morphologically including treelike forms the four families excluding boryaceae form a wellsupported clade in studies based on dna sequence analysis  all four contain relatively few species and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name hypoxidaceae sensu lato the relationship between boryaceae which includes only two genera borya and alania and other asparagales has remained unclear for a long time the boryaceae are mycorrhizal but not in the same way as orchids  morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between boryaceae and blandfordiaceae there is relatively low support for the position of boryaceae in the tree shown above the relationship shown between ixioliriaceae and tecophilaeaceae is still unclear some studies have supported a clade of these two families the clade from iridaceae upwards appears to have stronger support  all have some genetic characteristics in common having lost arabidopsistype telomeres  iridaceae is distinctive among the asparagales in the unique structure of the inflorescence a ripidium the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other asparagales members of the clade from iridaceae upwards have infralocular septal nectaries which rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries the next node in the tree xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato  the core asparagales has strong support  anomalous secondary thickening occurs among this clade eg in xanthorrhoea family xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato and dracaena family asparagaceae sensu lato with species reaching treelike proportions the core asparagales comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato are a strongly supported clade several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the asparagales based on phylogenetic evidence  earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies a 2009 study suggests that the asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots about the same as the order poales although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the eudicot order lamiales the clade with the highest rate', 'analogbrothers while the group only recorded one album together as the analog brothers a few bootlegs of its live concert performances including freestyles

canceled with that issue but response to the character was so positive that a solo title the amazing spiderman was launched with a march 1963 coverdate the character was created by writereditor stan lee and artist and coplotter steve ditko and the pair produced 38 issues from 1963 to 1966  ditko left after the 38th issue while lee remained as writer until issue 100  since then many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years chronicling the adventures of marvels most identifiable hero the initial years of the book under lee and ditko chronicled spidermans nascent career with his civilian life as hardluck yet perpetually goodhumored teenager peter parker parker balanced his career as spiderman with his job as a freelance photographer for the daily bugle under the bombastic editorpublisher j jonah jameson to help support himself and his frail aunt may  at the same time parker dealt with public hostility towards spiderman and the antagonism of his classmates flash thompson and liz allan at midtown high school while also embarking on a tentative illfated romance with jamesons secretary betty brant by focusing on parkers everyday problems lee and ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed selfdoubting superhero and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick  ditkos quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of marvels most prominent artist jack kirby and ditkos spiderman slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony combined with the humor and pathos of lees writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos most of spidermans key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time  issue 1 march 1963 featured the first appearances of j jonah jameson and his astronaut son john jameson and the supervillain the chameleon it also included the heros first encounter with the superhero team the fantastic four issue 2 may 1963 featured the first appearance of the vulture and the beginning of parkers freelance photography career at the newspaper the daily bugle the leeditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters including doctor octopus in 3 july 1963 the sandman and betty brant in 4 sept 1963 the lizard in 6 nov 1963 electro in 9 march 1964 mysterio in 13 june 1964 the green goblin in 14 july 1964

parker began attending empire state university in 31 dec 1965 the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates gwen stacy and harry osborn harrys father norman osborn first appeared in 23 april 1965 as a member of jamesons country club but is not named nor revealed as harrys father until 37 june 1966  probably the most celebrated issue of the leeditko run is 33 feb 1966 the third part of the story arc if this be my destiny and featuring the dramatic scene of spiderman through force of will and thoughts of family escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery although credited only as artist for most of his run ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them leaving lee to script the dialogue  however a rift between ditko and lee developed and the two men were not on speaking terms long before ditko completed his last issue the amazing spiderman 38 july 1966  the exact reasons for the ditkolee split have been a source of controversy ever since in successor penciler john romita srs first issue 39 aug 1966 archnemesis the green goblin discovers spidermans secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero   romitas spiderman  more muscular and heroiclooking than ditkos  became the model for two decades the leeromita era saw the introduction of such characters as daily bugle managing editor joseph robbie robertson in 52 sept 1967 and nypd captain george stacy father of parkers girlfriend gwen stacy in 56 jan 1968  the most important supporting character to be introduced during the romita era was mary jane watson who made her first full appearance in 42 nov 1966 although she first appeared  in 25 june 1965 with her face obscured and had been mentioned since 15 aug 1964 lee and romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in parkers world by improving parkers relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on spidermans adventures the stories also became more topical addressing issues such as civil rights racism prisoners rights the vietnam war and political elections issue 50 june 1967 introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the kingpin who would become a major force as well in the superhero series daredevil other notable first appearances in the leeromita era include the rhino in 41 oct 1966 the shocker in 46 march 1967 the prowler in 78 nov 1969 and the kingpins son richard fisk in 83 april 1970 two spinoff series debuted in the 1970s  marvel teamup in 1972 and the spectacular spiderman in 1976  the flagship titles second decade took a grim turn with a story in 8990 oct nov 1970 featuring the death of captain george stacy this was also the first spiderman story to be penciled by gil kane who would alternate drawing duties with romita for the next yearandahalf and would draw several landmark issues one such story took place in the controversial issues 9698 mayjuly 1971  writereditor lee defied the comics code authority with this story in which parkers friend harry osborn was hospitalized after tripping on lsd lee wrote this story upon a request from the us department of health education and welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs  citing its dictum against depicting drug use even in an antidrug context the cca refused to put its seal on these issues  with the approval of marvel publisher martin goodman lee had the comics published without the seal the comics sold well and marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts the cca subsequently loosened the code to permit negative depictions of drugs among other new freedoms the sixarm saga of 100102 septnov 1971 introduced morbius the living vampire the second installment was the first amazing spiderman story not written by cocreator lee with  roy thomas taking over writing the book for several months before stan lee returned to write 105110 feb july 1972  lee who was going on to become marvel comics publisher with thomas becoming editorinchief then turned writing duties over to 19yearold wunderkind gerry conway who scripted the series through 1975  romita penciled conways first halfdozen issues which introduced the gangster hammerhead in 113 oct 1972  kane then succeeded romita as penciler although romita would continue inking kane for a time the most memorable work of the conwaykaneromita team was 121122 junejuly 1973 which featured  the death of gwen stacy at the hands of the green goblin in the night gwen stacy died 121   her demise and the goblins apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of spiderman the aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of mary jane watson and her relationship with parker by late 1973 gil kane was succeeded by ross andru whose run lasted nearly 60 issues from 1973 to 1978  issue 129 feb 1974 introduced the punisher who would become one of marvel comics most popular characters the conwayandru era also featured the first appearances of the manwolf in 124125 sept oct 1973 the nearmarriage of doctor octopus and aunt may in

green goblin harry osborns psychiatrist bart hamilton marv wolfman marvels editorinchief from 1975 to 1976 succeeded wein as writer and in his first issue 182 july 1978 had parker propose marriage to watson who refused in the following issue  keith pollard succeeded ross andru as artist shortly afterward and with wolfman introduced the likable rogue the black cat felicia hardy in 194 july 1979  as a love interest for spiderman the black cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade by mid1984 tom defalco and ron frenz took over scripting and penciling  defalco helped establish the maturation in parker and watsons relationship laying the foundation for the characters eventual wedding  notably in 257 oct 1984 watson tells parker that she knows he is spiderman and in 259 dec 1984 she reveals to parker the extent of her troubled childhood  other notable issues of the defalcofrenz era include 252 may 1984 with the first appearance of spidermans black costume which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years worth of comics the debut of criminal mastermind the rose in 253 june 1984 the revelation in 258 nov 1984 that the black costume is a living being a symbiote and the introduction of the female mercenary silver sable in 265 june 1985 tom defalco and ron frenz were both removed from amazing spiderman in 1986 by editor owsley under acrimonious circumstances a succession of artists including alan kupperberg john romita jr and alex saviuk penciled the book from 1987 to 1988 owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987 scripting the fivepart gang war story 284288 that defalco plotted  former spectacular spiderman writer peter david scripted 289 june 1987 which revealed ned leeds as being the hobgoblin although this was retconned in 1996 by roger stern into leeds not being the original hobgoblin after all david michelinie took over as writer in the next issue for a story arc in 290292 julysept 1987 that led to the marriage of peter parker and mary jane watson in amazing spiderman annual 21  issue 298 march 1988 was the first spiderman comic to be drawn by future industry star todd mcfarlane the first regular artist on amazing spiderman since frenzs departure  mcfarlane revolutionized spidermans look  his depiction  largeeyed with wiry contorted limbs and messy knotted convoluted webbing  influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character  mcfarlanes other significant contribution to the spiderman canon was the design for what would become one of spidermans most wildly popular antagonists the supervillain venom issue 299 april 1988 featured venoms first appearance a lastpage cameo before his first full appearance in 300 may 1988  the latter issue also featured spiderman reverting to his original redandblue costume other notable issues of the micheliniemcfarlane era include 312 feb 1989 featuring the green goblin vs the hobgoblin and 315317 mayjuly 1989 with the return of venom after the editorial and creative turmoil that beset amazing spiderman in 1987 the micheliniemcfarlane team at the tailend of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book and set the tone for spiderman for the next decade with a civilian life as a married man the spiderman of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades  following his 19881989 run on amazing spiderman todd mcfarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply spiderman mcfarlanes successor erik larsen penciled the book from early 1990 to mid1991  after issue 350 larsen was succeeded by mark bagley who had won the 1986 marvel tryout contest and was assigned a number of lowprofile penciling jobs followed by a run on new warriors in 1990  bagley penciled the flagship spiderman title from 1991 to 1996 with his art forming the basis for most spiderman licensed merchandise of the decade and onward issues 361363 apriljune 1992 introduced carnage a second symbiote nemesis for spiderman the series 30thanniversary issue 365 aug 1992 was a doublesized hologramcover issue with the cliffhanger ending of peter parkers parents long thought dead reappearing alive it would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors who are killed in 388 april 1994 scripter michelinies last issue  his 19871994 stint gave him the secondlongest run as writer on the title behind stan lee with 389 writer j m dematteis whose spiderman credits included the 1987 kravens last hunt story arc and a 19911993 run on the spectacular spiderman took over the title  from october 1994 to june 1996 amazing stopped running stories exclusive to it and ran installments of multipart stories that crossed over into all the spiderman books  one of the few selfcontained stories during this period was in 400 april 1995 which featured the death of aunt may  later revealed to have been faked the clone saga culminated with the revelation that the spiderman who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real spiderman this plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers and was later reversed in the revelations story arc that crossed over the spiderman books in late 1996 the clone saga tied into a publishing gap after 406 oct 1995 when the title was temporarily replaced by the amazing scarlet spider 12 nov dec 1995 featuring ben reilly the series picked up again with 407 jan 1996 with tom defalco returning as writer  bagley completed his 5year run by september 1996  a succession of artists including ron garney steve skroce joe bennett and rafael kayanan penciled the book until the final issue  441 nov 1998 after which marvel rebooted the title with vol 2 1 jan 1999 marvel began the amazing spiderman anew with vol 2 1 jan 1999  howard mackie wrote the first 29 issues the relaunch proved controversial with the sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the death of maryjane which was ultimately reversed due to fan backlash  other elements included the introduction of a new spiderwoman who was spun off into her own shortlived series and major references to john byrnes controversial spiderman chapter one which launched at the same time as the reboot  mackies run would end with the amazing spiderman annual 2000 which saw the return of mary jane who left her husband upon reuniting with him with 30 june 2001 j michael straczynski took over as writer  while his arrival saw the title regain lost readers straczynski oversaw additional controversial storylines  most notably his lengthy spidertotem arc which raised the issue of whether spidermans powers were magicbased rather than as the result of a radioactive spiders bite  additionally straczynski resurrected the plot point of aunt may discovering her nephew was spiderman and returned mary jane with the couple reuniting in the amazing spiderman 50  straczynski also gave spiderman a new profession having parker teach at his former high school issue 30 began a dual numbering system with the original series numbering 471 returned and placed alongside the volumetwo number on the cover  other longtime rebooted marvel comics titles including fantastic four were given the dual numbering around this time  in october 2000 john romita jr succeeded john byrne as artist  after vol 2 58 nov 2003 the title reverted to its original numbering for 500 december 2003 with vol 2 158 considered 442499 of the original run  mike deodato jr penciled the book from mid2004 until 2006 the 2006 civil war crossover story arc included the amazing spiderman during this arc peter parker reveals his spiderman identity on live television this story arc crossover also marked the end of straczynskis sixandahalf years as writer from 20012007 on the amazing spiderman after 75 issues including issues of friendly neighborhood spiderman and the sensational spiderman as part of crossovers following this marvel made the amazing spiderman the companys sole spiderman title increased its frequency of publication to three issues monthly and inaugurated the series with a sequence of back to basics story arcs under the banner of brand new day wherein parker now exists in a changed world where he and mary jane had never married and parker having no memory of being married to each her with domino effect differences in their immediate world the most notable of these revisions to spiderman continuity are the return of harry osborn whose death in spectacular spiderman 200 may 1993 is erased and the reestablishment of spidermans secret identity with no one except mary jane able to recall that parker is spiderman although he soon reveals his secret identity to the new avengers and the fantastic four the alternating regular writers are dan slott bob gale marc guggenheim fred van lente and zeb wells joined by a rotation of artists that includes chris bachalo phil jimenez mike mckone john romita jr and marcos martin joe kelly mark waid and roger stern later joined the writing team and barry kitson the artist roster with issue 648 jan 2011 the series became a

'foreignrelationsofarmenia since its independence armenia has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have friendly relations both with iran russia and the west including the united states and europe however the dispute over the armenian genocide and the recent war over nagornokarabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors azerbaijan and turkey armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the united nations the council of europe the commonwealth of independent states the organization for security and cooperation in europe natos partnership for peace the north atlantic cooperation council the international monetary fund the international bank for reconstruction and development the world trade organization and la

 armenia is represented in finland by a nonresident ambassador based in yerevan at the ministry of foreign affairs finland is represented in armenia by a non resident ambassador based in helsinki at the ministry of foreign affairs and an honorary consulate in yerevan around 1000 people of armenian descent live in finland francoarmenian relations have existed since the french and the armenians established contact in the armenian kingdom of cilicia and are close to this day 2006 was proclaimed the year of armenia in france greece was one of the first countries to recognize armenias independence on 21 september 1991 and one of those that have officially recognized the armenian genocide since the independence of armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations united nations osce council of europe bsec whilst greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the eu and armenia continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation visit by the president of armenia levon terpetrossian to greece in 1996 visit by the president of the hellenic republic costis stephanopoulos in 1999 visit by the president of armenia robert kocharyan to greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by greek president karolos papoulias to armenia in june 2007 greece is after russia the major military partner of armenia armenian officers are trained in greek military academies and various technical assistance is supplied by greece since 2003 an armenian platoon has been deployed in kosovo as part of kfor where they operate as a part of the greek battalion of kfor armenia has represented in portugal through its embassy in rome italy  portugal is represented in armenia through its embassy in moscow russia one of the most notable armenians who resided in portugal was calouste gulbenkian he was a wealthy armenian businessman and philantropist who made lisbon the headquarters for his businesses he established the international charity the calouste gulbenkian foundation in lisbon he also founded the museu calouste gulbenkian in lisbon armenias most notable recent foreign policy success came with the august 29 treaty with russia on friendship cooperation and mutual assistance in which moscow committed itself to the defense of armenia should it be attacked by a third party  russia is the key regional security player and has proved a valuable historical ally for armenia although it appeared as a response to aliyevs us trip the treaty had probably long been under development   however it is clear from the wider context of armenian foreign policy thatwhile yerevan welcomes the russian security guaranteethe country does not want to rely exclusively on moscow nor to become part of a confrontation between russian and usled alliances in the transcaucasus armenianukrainian relations have lasted for centuries and today are cordial note armenia and azerbaijan do not have formal diplomatic relations today the two nations have fought two wars in 191820 armenianazerbaijani war and in 198894 nagornokarabakh war in the past century with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in bishkek there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries because of the of the ongoing nagornokarabakh conflict and dispute  in 2008 azerbaijani president ilham aliyev declared that nagorno karabakh will never be independent the position is backed by international mediators as well armenia has to accept the reality and that in 1918 yerevan was granted to the armenians it was a great mistake the khanate of iravan was the azeri territory the armenians were guests here the neighboring nations of armenia and azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918  the two nations have fought two wars in 191820 and in 198894 in the past century with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in bishkek in 2008 azerbaijani president ilham aliyev declared that nagorno karabakh will never be independent the position is backed by international mediators as well armenia has to accept the reality and that in 1918 yerevan was granted to the armenians it was a great mistake the khanate of iravan was the azeri territory the armenians were guests here during the soviet period many armenians and azeris lived side by side in peace  however when mikhail gorbachev introduced the policies of glasnost and perestroika the majority of armenians from the nagornokarabakh autonomous oblast nkao of the azerbaijan ssr began a movement to unify with the armenian ssr in 1988 the armenians of karabakh voted to secede and join armenia this along with mutual massacres in azerbaijan and armenia resulted in the conflict that became known as the nagornokarabakh war the violence resulted in de facto armenian control of former nkao and seven surrounding azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a ceasefire which has been in effect since may 1994 and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the osce minsk group the minsk group is currently cochaired by the us france and russia and comprises armenia azerbaijan turkey and several western european nations  despite the cease fire up to 40 clashes are reported along the nagornokarabakh conflict lines of control each year the two countries are still technically at war  citizens of the republic of armenia as well as citizens of any other country who are of armenian descent are forbidden entry to the republic of azerbaijan if a persons passport shows any evidence of travel to nagornokarabakh barring a diplomatic passport they are forbidden entry to the republic of azerbaijan in 2008 in what became known as the 2008 mardakert skirmishes armenia and azerbaijan clashed over nagornokarabakh the fighting between the two sides was brief with few casualties on either side armenians and georgians have a lot in common   both are ancient christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets   both use the terms apostolic and orthodox in the full titles of their respective churches they also use the term catholicos to refer to their church patriarchs   despite all this however armenians and georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship at times sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals today relations with georgia are of particular importance for armenia because under the economic blockade imposed by turkey and azerbaijan due to the ongoing karabakh conflict georgia offers armenia its only land connection with europe and access to its black sea ports  however because of armenias reliance on russia and georgia both of whom fought the 2008 south ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result and as 70 of armenias imports entered via georgia especially from russia which has imposed an economic blockade on georgia armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well the development of close relations between turkey and georgia such as the bakutbilisiceyhan oil pipeline and south caucasus natural gas pipeline have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the armenian genocide on occasion however georgian politicians have sympathized with the armenian cause   for example on march 20 2006 georgian ambassador to armenia revaz gachechiladze stated we sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation  when the time comes georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the armenian genocide by the international community including georgia however armeniangeorgian relations have begun to improve   on may 10 2006 armenia and georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries the javakheti region in southern georgia contains a large armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations such as united javakhk pushing for autonomy there has been no violence between armenians and georgians in the area despite religious and ideological differences relations between armenia and the islamic republic of iran remain cordial and both armenia and iran are strategic partners in the region  armenia and iran enjoy cultural and historical ties that go back thousands of years  there are no border disputes between the two countries and the christian armenian minority in iran enjoys official recognition  of special importance is the cooperation in the field of energy security which lowers armenias dependence on russia and can in the future also supply iranian gas to europe through georgia and the black sea since independence armenia has received support from israel and today remains one of its major trade partners   while both countries have diplomatic relations neither maintains an embassy in the other country   instead ehude moshe eytam the israeli ambassador to armenia is based in tbilisi georgia and visits yerevan twice a month  israel has recognized 10 armenians as righteous among the nations for risking their lives to save jews during the holocaust but does not recognize the armenian genocide partly because of its relations with turkey which is one of the few countries in the middle east that recognizes israel and partly because of its insistence that the holocaust was unique armenianlebanese relations are very friendly   lebanon is host to the eighth largest armenian population in the world and is the only member of the arab league much less of the middle east and the islamic world that recognizes the armenian genocide during the 2006 lebanon war armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to lebanon according to the armenian government an unspecified amount of medicines tents and firefighting equipment was allocated to lebanese authorities on july 27 2006 armeniapakistan relations are extraordinarily poor owing to numerous disagreements the main issue is armenias invasion and occupation of azerbaijan territories including nagornokarabakh pakistan has supported territorial integrity of azerbaijan during and after the nagornokarabakh war pakistan also opposes armenian irredentist claims against turkey and azerbaijan pakistan does not recognize the 1915 genocide and maintains that during the war large number of armenians and muslims were killed  armenia has friendly relations with india and its recognition of kashmir belonging to india has also damaged the relations with pakistan pakistan is also the only country that does not recognize armenia pakistan has cultural ethnic historical and religious ties with azerbaijan and turkey pakistan has close military ties with azerbaijan trains azerbaijani armed forces and plans to sell its jf17 fighters to azerbaijan turkey was one of the first countries to recognize armenias independence in 1991   despite this for most of the 20th century and early 21st century relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons some bones of contention include the unresolved karabakh conflict between armenia and azerbaijan which has resulted in turkey imposing a blockade on armenia that is still in effect today the treatment of armenians in turkey the bakutbilisiceyhan oil pipeline and the armenian claim of turkeys holding of historic armenian lands ceded to them in the treaty of kars a treaty which armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the soviet union and turkey and not between armenia and turkey proper   at the forefront of all disputes however is the issue surrounding the armenian genocide the killing and deportation of between one and oneandahalf million armenians from eastern anatolian lands of the ottoman empire orchestrated by the young turks is a taboo subject in turkey itself as the turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened  however since turkey has become a candidate to join the european union limited discussion of the event is now taking place in turkey some in the european parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for turkey to join the eu should be the full recognition of the event as genocide on june 5 2005 armenian president robert kocharian announced that he was ready to continue dialogue with azerbaijan for the settlement of the nagornokarabakh conflict and with turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions    armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the armenian ssr it is loyal to the treaty of kars and all agreements inherited by the former soviet armenian government in the wake of the 2008 south ossetia war between russia and georgia armenia and turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship   according to the economist magazine 70 of armenias imports enter via georgia because of the apparently belligerent posture of the russian state economic ties with turkey appear especially attractive the first armenians migrated to australia in the 1850s during the gold rush the majority came to australia in the 1960s starting with the armenians of egypt after nasser came to power then in the early 1970s from cyprus after the turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992 a period of civil unrest in lebanon persontoperson governmental links are increasing although they are still modest  in september 2003 the hon mr philip ruddock mp visited armenia in his former capacity as australian minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs in october 2005 the armenian foreign minister he mr vardan oskanyan visited australia in november 2005 the hon mr joe hockey mp minister for human services visited armenia the parliament of the commonwealth of australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of armenians in 1915 as genocide although the state of nsw passed a law recognising this several years earlier the australian government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the opposition labor party declared it will push for the recognition of the armenian genocide in australian parliament if labor wins the elections chile recognized the armenian genocide on september 14 2007 the dissolution of the soviet union in december 1991 brought an end to the cold war and created the opportunity for bilateral relations with the new independent states nis as they began a political and economic transformation the us recognized the independence of armenia on december 25 1991 and opened an embassy in yerevan in february 1992', 'alloy an alloy is a partial or complete solid solution of one or more elements in a metallic matrix  complete solid solution alloys give single solid phase microstructure while partial solutions give two or more phases that may be homogeneous in distribution depending on thermal heat treatment history  alloys usually have different properties from those of the component elements alloys constituents are usually measured by mass alloying one metal with other metals or nonmetals often enhances its properties  for example steel is stronger than iron its primary element the physical properties such as density reactivity youngs modulus and electrical and thermal conductivity of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials  this is sometimes due to the sizes of the atoms in the alloy since larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors helping the alloy resist deformation   sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element occur   for example impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties as first predicted by white hogan suhl tian abrie and nakamura some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals  bronze an alloy of copper and tin was the first alloy discovered during the prehistoric period now known as the bronze age it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties  in later times bronze has been used for ornaments bells statues and bearings  brass is an alloy made from copper and zinc unlike pure metals most alloys do not have a single melting point but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases the temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus  however for most alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents in rare cases twothe eutectic mixturewhich gives the alloy a unique melting point the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal the primary metal is called the base if there is a mixture of only two types of atoms not counting impurities such as a coppernickel alloy then it is called a binary alloy  if there are three different types of atoms forming the mixture such as iron nickel and chromium then it is called a ternary alloy  an alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy while a five part alloy is termed a quinary alloy  since the percentage of each constituent can be varied with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system  in this respect all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents like iron and carbon is called a binary system while all of the different alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy such as alloys of iron carbon and chromium is called a ternary system when a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two different mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism the relative size of each atom in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur  when the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are replaced with atoms of the other constituent  with the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller that the other and so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix called the interstices alloys are often made in order to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal to induce hardness toughness ductility or other desired properties  while most metals and alloys can be  work hardened by inducing defects in their crystal structure caused by plastic deformation some alloys can also have their properties altered by heat treatment  nearly all metals can be softened by annealing which repairs the crystal defects but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling  many alloys of aluminum copper magnesium titanium and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment but few respond to this to the same degree that steel does at a certain temperature the base metal of steel iron undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix called allotropy  this allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the crystal  when this happens the carbon atoms are said to be in solution or mixed with the iron if the iron is cooled slowly the carbon atoms will be forced out of solution into the spaces between the crystals if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms become trapped in solution causing the iron crystals to deform when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state inducing great hardness in practice some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy  for example 14 karat gold is an alloy of gold with other elements  similarly the silver used in jewelry and the aluminium used as a structural building material are also alloys the term alloy is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy  for example automobile wheels made of an aluminium alloy are commonly referred to as simply alloy wheels although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys the use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron  as no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel the alloy was used as it was iron is usually found as iron ore on earth except for one deposit of native iron in greenland which was used by the inuit people  native copper however was found worldwide along with silver gold and platinum which were also used to make tools jewelry and other objects since neolithic times  copper was the hardest of these metals and the most widely distributed it became one of the most important metals to the ancients  eventually humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore and around 2500 bc began alloying the two metals to form bronze which is much harder than its ingredients  tin was rare however being found mostly in great britain in the middle east people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass  ancient civilizations made use of the information contained in modern alloy constitution diagrams taking into account the mixture and the various properties it produced such as hardness toughness and melting point under various conditions of temperature and work hardening the first known smelting of iron began in anatolia around 1800 bc called the bloomery process it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron and by 800 bc the technology had spread to europe pig iron a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon was being produced in china as early as 1200 bc but did not arrive in europe until the middle ages these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 bc these steels were of poor quality and the introduction of pattern welding around the 1st century ad sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them to create a tougher metal mercury had been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years  mercury dissolves many metals such as gold silver and tin to form amalgams an alloy in a soft paste or liquid form at ambient temperature  amalgams have been used since 200 bc in china for plating objects with precious metals called gilding such as armor and mirrors the ancient romans often used mercurytin amalgams for gilding their armor the amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized leaving the gold silver or tin behind  mercury was often used in mining to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes  in ancient egypt and mycenae gold was often alloyed with copper to produce redgold or iron to produce a bright burgundygold  silver was often found alloyed with gold  these metals were also used to strengthen each other for more practical purposes  quite often precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers  around 250 bc archimedes was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown leading to the famous bathhouse shouting of eureka upon the discovery of archimedes principle while the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 bc mainly due to interruptions in the trade routes for tin the metal is much softer than bronze  however very small amounts of steel an alloy of iron and around 1 carbon was always a byproduct of the bloomery process the ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 bc and the rare material was valued for use in tool and weapon making  since the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to fully melt iron the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the middle ages this method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time but the penetration of carbon was not very deep so the alloy was not very homogenous  in 1740 benjamin huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel  huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s with the introduction of the blast furnace to europe in the middle ages pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron  since pig iron could be melted people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron in order to create steel  puddling was introduced during the 1700s where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air to remove the carbon by oxidation  in 1858 sir henry bessemer developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content the bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel', 'alphadecay an alpha particle is the same as a helium4 nucleus and both mass number and atomic number are the same alpha decay is by far the most common form of cluster decay where the parent atom ejects a defined daughter collection of nucleons leaving another defined product behind in nuclear fission a number of different pairs of daughters of approximately equal size are formed  alpha decay is the most likely cluster decay because of the combined extremely high binding energy and relatively small mass of the helium4 product nucleus the alpha particle alpha decay like other cluster decays is fundamentally a quantum tunneling process  unlike beta decay alpha decay is governed by the interplay between the nuclear force and the electromagnetic force alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides  in theory it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel element 28 where overall binding energy per nucleon is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fissiontype processes  in practice this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel with the lightest known alpha emitter being the lightest isotopes mass numbers 106110 of tellurium element 52 alpha particles have a typical kinetic energy of 5mev that is 013 of their total energy ie 110tjkg and a speed of 15000kms  this corresponds to a speed of around 005c  there is surprisingly small variation around this energy due to the heavy dependence of the halflife of this process on the energy produced see equations in the geigernuttall law because of their relatively large mass 2 electric charge and relatively low velocity alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy so their forward motion is effectively stopped within a few centimeters of air most of the helium produced on earth approximately 99 of it is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of minerals containing uranium or thorium the helium is brought to the surface as a byproduct of natural gas production alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by ernest rutherford in 1899 and by 1907 they were identified as he2 ions  for more details of this early work see alpha particlehistory of discovery and use by 1928 george gamow had solved the theory of the alpha decay via tunneling the alpha particle is trapped in a potential well by the nucleus  classically it is forbidden to escape but according to the then newly discovered principles of quantum mechanics it has a tiny but nonzero probability of tunneling through the barrier and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus  gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the halflife of the decay and the energy of the emission which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the geigernuttall law americium241 an alpha emitter is used in smoke detectors the alpha particles ionize air between a small gap a small current is passed through that ionized air  smoke particles from fire that enter the air gap reduce the current flow sounding the alarm alpha decay can provide a safe power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators used for space probes and artificial heart pacemakers  alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay  plutonium238 for example requires only 25mm of lead shielding to protect against unwanted radiation static eliminators typically use polonium210 an alpha emitter to ionize air allowing the static cling to more rapidly dissipate being relatively heavy and positively charged alpha particles tend to have a very short mean free path and quickly lose kinetic energy within a short distance of their source  this results in several mev being deposited in a relatively small volume of material  this increases the chance of cellular damage in cases of internal contamination  in general external alpha radiation is not harmful since alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air a piece of paper or the thin layer of dead skin cells  even touching an alpha source is usually not harmful though many alpha sources also are accompanied by betaemitting radio daughters and alpha emission is also accompanied by gamma photon emission if substances emitting alpha particles are ingested inhaled injected or introduced through the skin then it could result in a measurable dose the relative biological effectiveness rbe of alpha radiation is higher than that of beta or gamma radiation  rbe quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects notably either cancer or celldeath for equivalent radiation exposure the higher value for alpha radiation is generally attributable to the high linear energy transfer let which is about one ionization of a chemical bond for every ngstrm of travel by the alpha particle the rbe has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations the rbe is set at 10 for neutron irradiation and at 1 for beta radiation and ionizing photons however another component of alpha radiation is the recoil of the parent nucleus termed alpha recoil  due to the conservation of momentum requiring the parent nucleus to recoil the effect acts much like the kick of a rifle butt when a bullet goes in the opposite direction  this gives a significant amount of energy to the recoiling nucleus which also causes ionization damage the total energy of the recoil nucleus is readily calculable and is roughly the weight of the alpha 4u divided by the weight of the parent typically about 200u times the total energy of the alpha  by some estimates this might account for most of the internal radiation damage as the recoil nuclei are typically heavy metals which preferentially collect on the chromosomes  in some studies the largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is radon a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in soil and rock if the gas is inhaled some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung  these particles continue to decay emitting alpha particles which can damage cells in the lung tissue the death of marie curie at age 66 from leukemia was probably caused by prolonged exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation but it is not clear if this was due to alpha radiation or xrays  curie worked extensively with radium which decays into radon along with other radioactive materials that emit beta and gamma rays  however curie also worked with unshielded xray tubes during world war i and analysis of her skeleton during a reburial showed a relatively low level of radioisotope burden russian dissident alexander litvinenkos 2006 murder by radiation poisoning is thought to have been carried out with polonium210 an alpha emitter', 'apatosaurus the cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of diplodocus and the bones of the leg were much stockier despite being longer implying a more robust animal the tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion  like most sauropods apatosaurus had only a single large claw on each forelimb with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws fossils of this animal have been found in nine mile quarry and bone cabin quarry in wyoming and at sites in colorado oklahoma and utah present in stratigraphic zones 26 it was roughly the weight of four elephants  one specimen of a excelsus was estimated to weigh convert25952 estimates for a louisae were convert20600 other estimates of the body mass of adult apatosaurus species range from convert18000 to convert35000 the skull was small in comparison with the size of the animal the jaws were lined with spatulate teeth which resembled chisels suited to an herbivorous diet  like other sauropods the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated that is they carried paired spines creating a wide and deep profile for the neck the apparently massive neck was however filled with an extensive system of weightsaving air sacs  apatosaurus like its close relative supersaurus is notable for the incredibly tall spines on its vertebrae which make up more than half the height of the individual bones  also unusual among diplodocids is the shape of the tail which is comparatively thin in breadth and short in height a profile caused by the vertebral spines decreasing in height rapidly the farther they are from the hips  apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids giving it an unusually deep chest the limb bones were also very robust in 1877 othniel charles marsh published the name of the type species apatosaurus ajax he followed this in 1879 with a description of another more complete specimen which he thought represented a new genus and named brontosaurus excelsus  in 1903 elmer riggs pointed out that brontosaurus excelsus was in fact so similar to apatosaurus ajax that it belonged in the same genus which riggs reclassified as apatosaurus excelsus  according to the rules of the iczn which governs the scientific names of animals the name apatosaurus having been published first had priority as the official name brontosaurus was a junior synonym and therefore discarded from formal use othniel charles marsh a professor of paleontology at yale university described and named an incomplete and juvenile skeleton of apatosaurus ajax in 1877  two years later marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at como bluff wyoming  which because of discrepancies including the size difference marsh incorrectly identified as belonging to an entirely new genus and species he dubbed the new species brontosaurus excelsus meaning thunder lizard from the greek bront meaning thunder and sauros meaning lizard and from the latin excelsus highest sublime referring to the greater number of sacral vertebrae than in any other genus of sauropod known at the time the finds  the largest dinosaur ever discovered at the time and nearly complete lacking only a head feet and portions of the tail  were then prepared for what was to be the first ever mounted display of a sauropod skeleton at yales peabody museum of natural history in 1905  the missing bones were created using known pieces from close relatives of brontosaurus sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry were added as well as a tail fashioned to appear as marsh believed it should as well as a composite model of what he felt the skull of this massive creature might look like  this was not a delicate diplodocusstyle skull which would later turn out to be more accurate but was composed of the biggest thickest strongest skull bones lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries primarily those of camarasaurus the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time  this method of reconstructing incomplete skeletons based on the more complete remains of related dinosaurs continues in museum mounts and life restorations to this day despite the muchpublicized debut of the mounted skeleton which cemented the name brontosaurus in the public consciousness elmer riggs had published a paper in the 1903 edition of geological series of the field columbian museum which argued that brontosaurus was not different enough from apatosaurus to warrant its own genus and created the combination apatosaurus excelsus  in view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous  as the term apatosaurus has priority brontosaurus will be regarded as a synonym despite this at least one paleontologistrobert bakkerargued in the 1990s that a ajax and a excelsus are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus  this idea has not been accepted by many palaeontologists early on it was believed that apatosaurus was too massive to support its own weight on dry land so it was theorized that the sauropod must have lived partly submerged in water perhaps in a swamp  recent findings do not support this  in fact like its relative diplodocus apatosaurus was a grazing animal with a very long neck and a long tail that served as a counterweight  one study suggested that diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed and that sauropods like apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding in 2008 footprints of juvenile apatosaurus were reported from quarry five in morrison colorado discovered in 2006 by matthew mossbrucker these footprints show that juveniles could run on their hind legs in a manner similar to that of the modern basilisk lizard in the early 20th century diplodocids like apatosaurus were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air allowing them to graze from tall trees  more recently scientists have argued that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain  furthermore more recent studies have shown that the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have permitted the neck to bend far upwards  however subsequent studies demonstrated that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal alert posture and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals  apatosaurus like diplodocus would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture given the large body mass of apatosaurus combined with its long neck physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals managed to breathe beginning with the assumption that apatosaurus like crocodilians did not have a diaphragm the deadspace volume the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth trachea and air tubes after each breath has been estimated at about 184 liters for a 30 ton specimen its tidal volume the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath has been calculated based on the following respiratory systems on this basis its respiratory system could not have been reptilian as its tidal volume would not have been able to replace its deadspace volume  likewise the mammalian system would only provide a fraction of new air on each breath  therefore it must have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like birds ie multiple air sacs and a flowthrough lung  furthermore an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600 liters compared to a mammalian requirement of 2950 liters which would exceed the available space the overall thoracic volume of apatosaurus has been estimated at 1700 liters allowing for a 500liter fourchambered heart like birds not threechambered like reptiles and a 900liter lung capacity  that would allow about 300 liters for the necessary tissue  assuming apatosaurus had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian restingmetabolism it would need to consume only about 262 liters 69 gallons of water per day an article that appeared in the november 1997 issue of discover magazine reported research into the mechanics of apatosaurus tails by nathan myhrvold a computer scientist from microsoft myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail which in diplodocids like apatosaurus was a very long tapering structure resembling a bullwhip  this computer modeling suggested that sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibelsdateseptember 2009 comparable to the volume of a cannon the length of time taken for marshs misclassification to be brought to public notice meant that the name brontosaurus associated as it was with one of the largest dinosaurs became so famous that it persisted long after the name had officially been abandoned in scientific use as late as 1989 the us post office issued four dinosaur stamps tyrannosaurus stegosaurus pteradon misspelling of pteranodon which is a pterosaur and not a dinosaur and brontosaurus the inclusion of these last two led to  complaints of fostering scientific illiteracy the post office defended itself in postal bulletin 21744 by saying although now recognized by the scientific community as apatosaurus the name brontosaurus was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population  stephen jay gould supported this position in his essay bully for brontosaurus though he echoed riggs original argument that brontosaurus is a synonym for apatosaurus nevertheless he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination sinclair oil has a long history of being a fixture on american roads and briefly in other countries with its green dinosaur logo and mascot an apatosaurus brontosaurus while sinclairs early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs eventually only apatosaurus was used as the official logo due to its popular appeal', 'angilbert saint angilbert died 18 february 814 was a frank who served charlemagne as a diplomat abbot poet and semisoninlaw he was of noble frankish parentage and educated at the palace school in aquae grani aachen under alcuin he is venerated as a saint on the day of his death18 february when charlemagne sent his young son pepin to italy as king of the lombards angilbert went along as primicerius palatii a high administrator of the satellite court  as the friend and adviser of pepin he assisted for a while in the government of italy angilbert delivered the document on iconoclasm from the frankish synod of frankfurt to pope adrian i and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope in 792 794 and 796 in 790 he was named abbot of centulum also called sancti richarii monasterium saintriquier in northern france where his brilliant rule gained for him later the renown of a saint it was not uncommon for the merovingian carolingian or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries  the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation   angilbert in contrast spent a great deal rebuilding saintriquier and when he completed it charlemagne spent easter of the year 800 there angilberts nonsacramental relationship with bertha was evidently recognized by the court  if she had not been the daughter of the king historians might refer to her as his concubine   they had at least two sons one of whom nithard became a notable figure in the mid9th century   control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the middle ages  bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices his poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family he accompanied charlemagne to rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 814  angilbert was the homer of the emperors literary circle and was the probable author of an epic of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii it is a mosaic from virgil ovid lucan and venantius fortunatus composed in the manner of einhards use of suetonius and exhibits a true poetic gift  of the shorter poems besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the avars 796 an epistle to david charlemagne incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperors palace the reference to bertha however is distant and respectful her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation angilberts poems have been published by e dummler in the monumenta germaniae historica for criticisms of this edition see traube in roederers schriften fr

has been the governing party of the commonwealth of australia since the 2007 federal election  julia gillard is the partys federal parliamentary leader and prime minister of australia labor also currently governs in a majority of states and territories founded in 1891 by the emerging labour movement in australia labor is the countrys longest running political party  labor contested state seats from 1891 and federal seats following the federation at the 1901 federal election  labor was the first party in australia to win a majority in either house of the australian parliament at the 1910 federal election the alp predates both the british labour party and new zealand labour party among others in both party formation and government the party competes against the liberalnational coalition for political office at the federal and state and sometimes local level the policy of the australian labor party is contained in its national platform which is approved by delegates to labors national conference held every three years  according to the labor partys website the platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees local branches unions state and territory governments and individual party members the platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal labor government the platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future labor government would follow but does not commit the party to specific policies it maintains that labors traditional values will remain a constant on which all australians can rely  while making it clear that labor is fully committed to a market economy it says that  labor believes in a strong role for national government  the one institution all australians truly own and control through our right to vote  labor will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands or located only in privileged communities the benefits must be shared by all australians and all our regions the platform and labor believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential  for labor government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by ensuring equal opportunity removing unjustifiable discrimination and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth income and status  further sections of the platform stress labors support for equality and human rights labour rights and democracy in practice the platform provides only general policy guidelines to labors federal state and territory parliamentary leaderships the policy labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the cabinet if the party is in office or the shadow cabinet if it is in opposition in consultation with key interest groups within the party and is contained in the parliamentary leaders policy speech delivered during the election campaign  when labor is in office the policies it implements are determined by the cabinet subject to the platform generally it is accepted that while the platform binds labor governments how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus it is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the partys parliamentary leadership as well as the factions  however where there is a direct contradiction with the platform labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy  for example privatisation legislation under the hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform the labor party is commonly described as a social democratic party but its constitution stipulates that it is a democratic socialist party the light on the hill is a phrase used to describe the objective of the australian labor party the phrase was coined in a 1949 conference speech by then prime minister ben chifley the party was created by and has always been influenced to some extent by trade unionists and its policy at any given time has been the policy of the broader labour movement  thus at the first federal election 1901 labors platform called for a white australia a view held by all federal mps at the time bar bruce smith a free trader a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes  labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs conscription and pacifism white australia and multiculturalism nationalisation and privatisation isolationism and internationalism as has the conservative side of australian politics in the aftermath of world war i and the russian revolution of 1917 support for socialism grew in trade union ranks and at the 1921 allaustralian trades union congress a resolution was passed calling for the socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange  as a result labors federal conference in 1922 adopted a similarly worded socialist objective which remained official policy for many years the resolution was immediately qualified however by the blackburn amendment which said that socialisation was desirable only when was necessary to eliminate exploitation and other antisocial features  in practice the socialist objective was a dead letter  only once has a federal labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ben chifleys bank nationalisation of 1947 and that was held by the high court to be unconstitutional however the idea that only the socialist working class formed labor is untrue  analysis of the early nsw labor caucus reveals a band of unhappy amateurs made up of blue collar workers a squatter an md and even a mine owner  in addition many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies  in the first grouping of state mps 17 of the 35 were freetraders some historically declare the party a mix of socialism liberalism pragmatism and laborism these commitments are deemed to place labor closer intellectually and historically to the 19th century colonial liberals as the forerunners to the labor party over the conservatives of the time various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the alp under gough whitlam resulting in what is now known as the socialist left who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more socially progressive ideals and labor right the now dominant faction that tends to be more economically liberal and focus to a lesser extent on social issues the whitlam government was the first australian government to use the term economic rationalism the gough whitlam labor government from 1972 to 1975 was different to previous labor governments in that it pursued socialdemocratic policies rather than democratic socialist policies a precursor to the partys current third way position  under the whitlam government tariffs across the board were cut by 25 percent after 23 years of labor being in opposition the bob hawke and paul keating governments from 1983 to 1996 pursued many economic policies associated with economic rationalism and the third way such as floating the australian dollar in 1983 reductions in trade tariffs taxation reforms changing from centralised wagefixing to enterprise bargaining the privatisation of qantas and commonwealth bank and deregulating the banking system  keating also proposed a gst in 1985 however due to its unpopularity amongst labor as well as the electorate was not adopted the party also refrained from other reforms such as wholesale labour market deregulation eg  workchoices the eventual gst the privatisation of telstra and welfare reform including work for the dole which john howard and the liberal party of australia were to initiate after winning office in 1996 it is also said by a former staff member of tony blair that new labour and blair learnt from the hawke government in the 1980s on how to govern when they took power in the uk former labor leader kevin rudds first speech to parliament in 1998 stated  competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth they must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy but markets sometimes fail requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy  there are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all we are not afraid of a vision in the labor party but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality  parties of the centre left around the world are wrestling with a similar challengethe creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society some call this the third way the nomenclature is unimportant  what is important is that it is a repudiation of thatcherism and its australian derivatives represented opposite it is in fact a new formulation of the nations economic and social imperatives  rudd is critical of free market economists such as friedrich hayek alp mythology says the first party branch was founded at a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree the tree of knowledge in barcaldine queensland in 1891  the balmain new south wales branch of the party also claims to be the oldest in australia the party as a serious electoral force dates from 1891 in new south wales 1893 in queensland and south australia and later in the other colonies  in new south wales in 1891 the first election contested by labour candidates as labor was spelt at the time  see etymology 35 of 141 seats were won by labour candidates  in 1899 anderson dawson formed a minority labour government in queensland the first in the world which lasted one week sections of state labour and the australian labour movement were mixed in their support for the federation of australia some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution claiming the senate as proposed was much too powerful similar to the antireformist colonial upper houses and the british house of lords they feared federation would distract attention from the need of social and industrial reform and further entrench the power of the conservative forces the first labour leader and prime minister chris watson was a supporter of federation but not its implementation after federation the federal parliamentary labour party informally known as the caucus first met on 8 may 1901 at parliament house melbourne the meeting place of the first federal parliament this is now taken as the founding date of the federal labor party but it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level the alp during its early years was distinguished by its rapid growth and success at a national level first forming a minority government under chris watson the first labour prime minister in the world for four months in 1904  andrew fisher then formed another minority government 190809  at the 1910 federal election fisher and labour became australias first federal majority government held australias first senate majority was the worlds first labour party majority government the first time the labour party had controlled any house of a legislature and the first time it controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature through its membership of the socialist international the alp is affiliated with democratic socialist socialdemocratic and labour parties in many countries the party was historically committed to socialist economic policies but this term was never clearly defined and no labor government ever attempted to implement socialism in any serious sense  labor supported national wage fixing and a strong welfare system it did not nationalise private enterprise the single exception to this was ben chifleys attempt to nationalise the private banks in the 1940s but this was ruled unconstitutional by the high court of australia the commitment to nationalisation was dropped by gough whitlam from its formation until the 1950s labor and its affiliated unions were the strongest defenders of the white australia policy which banned all noneuropean migration to australia this policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about racial purity shared by most australians at this time and partly by fears of economic competition from lowwage labour  in practice the party opposed all migration on the grounds that immigrants competed with australian workers and drove down wages until after world war ii when the chifley government launched a major immigration program the partys opposition to noneuropean immigration did not change until after the retirement of arthur calwell as leader in 1967  subsequently labor has become an advocate of multiculturalism although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels between the 2007 federal election and the 2008 western australian state election the party was in government nationally as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures  this was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the act and the nt gained selfgovernment the alp adopted the formal name australian labour party in 1908 but changed the spelling to labor in 1912  while it is standard practice in australian english both today and at the time to spell the word labour with a u the party was influenced by the united states labour movement and a prominent figure in the early history of the party the americanborn king omalley was successful in having the spelling modernised the change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the labour movement in general  furthermore the spelling labor had been acceptable in both british and australian english in earlier periods  see also  spelling in australian english the labor party has suffered three major splits in addition founding member joseph cook left the party in 1894 and went on to be prime minister of australia with the commonwealth liberal party in 191314 the australian labor party is a democratic and federal party which consists of both individual members and affiliated trade unions who between them decide the partys policies elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office the majority of trade unions in australia are affiliated to the party and their affiliation fees based on the size of their memberships makes up a large part of the partys income the party consists of six state and two territory branches each of which consists of local branches which any australian resident can join plus affiliated trade unions  individual members pay a membership fee which is graduated according to income  members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year although there are differences in the rules from state to state  in practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings  many members only become active during election campaigns the party has about 50000 individual members although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the partys electoral fortunes the members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences usually held annually although more frequent conferences are often held  these conferences decide policy and elect state or territory executives a state or territory president an honorary position usually held for a oneyear term and a state or territory secretary a fulltime professional position the larger branches also have fulltime assistant secretaries and organisers  in the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state however under recent national reforms at least 50 of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches the party holds a national conference every three years which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches many coming from affiliated trade unions although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference the national conference approves the partys platform and policies elects the national executive and appoints officebearers such as the national secretary who also serves as national campaign director during elections the current national secretary is karl bitar the most recent national conference was held from 30 july 2009 to 1 august 2009 the national leader of the labor party is elected by the labor members of the national parliament the caucus not by the conference  until recently the national conference elected the partys national president a largely honorary position but since 2003 the position has rotated amongst a presidential team of three directly elected by the partys individual members  each member of the team serves a oneyear term as national president with the other members serving as vicepresidents the current national president is anna bligh the national vicepresidents are michael williamson president from july 2009 to july 2010 and jenny mcallister the labor party contests national state and territory elections  in some states it also contests local government elections in others it does not preferring to allow its members to run as nonendorsed candidates the process of choosing candidates is called preselection  candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories  in some they are chosen by ballots of all party members in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference in still others by a combination of these two  labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in parliament in accordance with the platform and decisions made by a vote of the caucus they are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties the labor party has always had a left wing and a right wing but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions to which some party members belong and often pay an additional membership fee the two largest factions are labor unity on the right and the socialist left labor unity generally supports freemarket policies and the us alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues the national left although it seldom openly espouses socialism favours more state intervention in the economy is generally less enthusiastic about the us alliance and is often more progressive on social issues the factions are themselves divided into subfactions and there is a constantly changing pattern of factional and subfactional alliances around particular policy issues or around particular preselection disputes  frequently these alliances and disputes reflect power struggles between or within trade unions the trade unions are also factionally aligned the largest unions supporting the right are the australian workers union awu the national union of workers nuw and the shop distributive and allied employees association sda important unions supporting the left include the australian manufacturing workers union amwu the liquor hospitality and miscellaneous union lhmu the construction forestry mining and energy union cfmeu the australian services union asu and the maritime union of australia mua but these affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent the awu and the nuw for example are bitter rivals and the nuw sometimes aligns itself with the left to further its conflict with the awu moreover in some cases different branches may have different factional alignment  on some issues such as opposition to the howard governments industrial relations policy all the unions are in agreement and work as a bloc within the party preselections are usually conducted along factional lines although sometimes a nonfactional candidate will be given preferential treatment this happened with cheryl kernot in 1998 and again with peter garrett in 2004  deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place  preselections particularly for safe labor seats can sometimes be strongly contested along factional lines a particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of branch stacking signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots personation multiple voting and on occasions fraudulent electoral enrolment  trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections but party rules changes have stamped out this practice  preselection results are sometimes challenged and the national executive is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes see categoryaustralian labor party politicians for current alp federal politicians see', 'agrippinatheyounger agrippina the younger has been described by both the ancient and modern sources as ruthless ambitious violent and domineering she was a beautiful and reputable woman and according to pliny the elder she had a double canine in her upper right jaw a sign of good fortune  many ancient historians accuse agrippina of poisoning emperor claudius though accounts vary agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of agrippina the elder and germanicus she had three elder brothers nero julius caesar germanicus drusus caesar and the future emperor caligula and two younger sisters drusilla and livilla agrippinas two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus she was the namesake of her mother  agrippina the elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron who was the second daughter and fourth child of julia the elder and the statesman marcus vipsanius agrippa the father of julia the elder was the emperor augustus and julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to scribonia who had close blood relations with pompey the great and lucius cornelius sulla maternally agrippina was a direct descendant of augustus germanicus agrippinas father was a very popular general and politician  his mother was antonia minor and his father was the general nero claudius drusus he was antonia minors first child  germanicus had two younger siblings a sister named livilla and a brother the future emperor claudius claudius was agrippinas paternal uncle and third husband antonia minor was a daughter to octavia the younger by her second marriage to triumvir mark antony and octavia was the second eldest sister and fullblooded sister of augustus germanicus father drusus the elder was the second son of the empress livia drusilla by her first marriage to praetor tiberius nero and was the emperor tiberiuss younger brother and augustuss stepson  in the year 9 augustus ordered and forced tiberius to adopt germanicus who happened to be tiberiuss nephew as his son and heir  germanicus was a favorite of his greatuncle augustus who hoped that germanicus would succeed his uncle tiberius who was augustuss own adopted son and heir  this in turn meant that tiberius was also agrippinas adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal greatuncle agrippina was born at oppidum ubiorum a roman outpost on the rhine river located in present day cologne germany as a small child she travelled with her parents throughout the empire until she and her siblings apart from caligula returned to rome to live with and be raised by antonia her parents in the meantime journeyed to syria to complete official duties  one year later in october germanicus died suddenly in antioch modern antakya turkey germanicus death in the year 19 caused much public grief in rome and gave rise to rumors that he had been murdered by gnaeus calpurnius piso and munatia plancina on the orders of tiberius as his widow agrippina the elder returned to rome with his ashes  agrippina the younger was thereafter supervised by her mother her paternal grandmother antonia minor and her greatgrandmother livia all of them notable influential and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive she lived on the palatine hill in rome her greatuncle tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of the emperor augustus in 14 after her thirteenth birthday in 28 tiberius arranged for agrippina to marry her paternal second cousin gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in rome domitius came from a distinguished family of consular rank  through his mother antonia major domitius was a great nephew of augustus first cousin to claudius and second cousin to agrippina and caligula he had two sisters domitia lepida the elder and domitia lepida the younger domitia lepida the younger was the biological mother of the empress valeria messalina antonia major was the elder sister to antonia minor and the first daughter of octavia minor and mark antony according to suetonius domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character who according to suetonius was a man who was in every aspect of his life detestable and served as consul in 32  agrippina and domitius lived between antium anzio and rome not much is known about the relationship between them tiberius died on march 16 37 and her only surviving brother caligula became the new emperor  being the emperors sister gave agrippina some influence agrippina and her younger sisters julia drusilla and julia livilla received various honors from their brother which included but were not limited to around the time that tiberius died agrippina had become pregnant  domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child  in the early morning hours in antium of december 15 37 agrippina gave birth to her first child and the first child born to domitius a son  agrippina and domitius named their son lucius domitius ahenobarbus after the domitiuss recently deceased father  this child would grow up to become the emperor nero nero was agrippinas only natural child  suetonius states that domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son whereupon he replied i dont think anything produced by me and agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships  on june 10 38 drusilla died possibly of a fever rampant in rome at the time he was particularly fond of drusilla claiming to treat her as he would his own wife even though drusilla had a husband  following her death caligulas relationship with agrippina and livilla changed showing no special love or respect toward them after drusillas death  after this point he was said to have gone insane in 39 agrippina and livilla with their maternal cousin drusillas widower marcus aemilius lepidus were involved in a failed plot to murder caligula a plot known as the plot of the three daggers which was to make lepidus the new emperor  lepidus agrippina and livilla were contended to be lovers  not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it  at the trial of lepidus caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adultresses producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him lepidus was executed  agrippina and livilla were exiled by their brother to the pontine islands caligula sold their furniture jewellery slaves and freedmen  in january 40 domitius died of edema dropsy at pyrgi nero had gone to live with his second paternal aunt domitia lepida the younger after caligula had taken his inheritance away from him  caligula his wife milonia caesonia and their daughter julia drusilla were murdered on january 24 41  agrippinas paternal uncle claudius brother of her father germanicus became the new roman emperor claudius ordered agrippina and livilla to return from exile  livilla returned to her husband while agrippina was reunited with her estranged son  after the death of her first husband agrippina tried to make shameless advances to the future emperor galba who showed no interest in her and was devoted to his wife aemilia lepida on one occasion galbas motherinlaw gave agrippina in a whole bevy of married women a public reprimand and a slap in the face claudius had neros inheritance reinstated and arranged for gaius sallustius crispus passienus and domitia lepida the elder lucius first paternal aunt to divorce so that crispus could marry agrippina when agrippina returned she had nothing to return to  agrippina married crispus as her second husband and he became a step father to nero crispus was a prominent influential witty wealthy and powerful man who served twice as consul he was the adopted grandson and biological great great nephew of the historian sallust little is known on their relationship in the first years of claudius reign claudius was married to the infamous empress valeria messalina although agrippina was very influential she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor  messalina was agrippinas second paternal cousin  among the victims of messalinas intrigues were agrippinas surviving sister livilla who was charged with having adultery with seneca the younger seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to nero when agrippina returned from exile messalina realised that agrippinas son was a threat to her sons position and sent assassins to strangle lucius during his siesta the assassins left in terror when a snake suddenly darted from beneath neros pillowbut it was only a sloughedoff snakeskin in his bed near his pillow in 47 crispus died and at his funeral the rumor spread around that agrippina poisoned crispus to gain his estate  after being widowed a second time agrippina was left very wealthy  later that year at the secular games at the performance of the troy pageant messalina attended the event with her son britannicus agrippina was also present with lucius agrippina and lucius received greater applause from the audience than messalina and britannicus did  many people began to show pity and sympathy to agrippina due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life  agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family casus suorum and wrote an account of her mothers life after messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with gaius silius to overthrow her husband claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time  around this time agrippina became the mistress to one of claudius advisers the former greek freedman marcus antonius pallas at that time claudius advisers were discussing which noblewoman claudius should marry  claudius had a reputation that he was easily controlled by his wives and freedmen  his freedmen according to legend presented him three possible candidates the freedman tiberius claudius narcissus suggested claudius to remarry his second wife aelia paetina with whom he had a daughter claudia antonia narcissus also stated that paetina would cherish claudia octavia and britannicus claudiuss children with messalina in addition to antonia another freedman gaius julius callistus was against claudius remarrying paetina and stated to claudius that he divorced her before and that remarrying paetina would make her more arrogant  callistus suggested lollia paulina caligulas third wife and agrippinas former sisterinlaw instead pallas advised claudius that he should marry agrippina pallas stated to the emperor that as lucius was the grandson to claudiuss late brother germanicus by marrying agrippina claudius would ally the two branches of the claudian house and imperial family  in more recent times it has been suggested that the senate may have pushed for the marriage between agrippina and claudius to end the feud between the julian and claudian branches  this feud dated back to agrippinas mothers actions against tiberius after the death of germanicus actions which tiberius had gladly punished regardless for agrippinas seduction it was a help that she had the nieces privilege of kissing and caressing her paternal uncle  claudius was seduced by her passions claudius made references to her in his speeches my daughter and foster child born and bred in my lap so to speak  when claudius decided to marry her he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest  in roman society an uncle claudius marrying his niece agrippina was considered an incestuous relationship and a subject of controversy at the time agrippina and claudius married on new years day 49  this marriage caused widespread disapproval  this was a part of agrippinas scheming plan to make lucius the new emperor her marriage to claudius wasnt based on love but on power she quickly eliminated her rival lollia paulina in 49 shortly after marrying claudius agrippina charged paulina with black magic  paulina did not receive a hearing  her property was confiscated she left italy and on agrippinas orders she committed suicide in the months leading up to her marriage to claudius agrippinas maternal second cousin the praetor lucius junius silanus torquatus was betrothed to claudius daughter claudia octavia this betrothal was broken off in 48 when agrippina scheming with consul lucius vitellius the elder the father of the future emperor aulus vitellius had falsely charged silanus with having open incest with his sister junia calvina agrippina did this hopefully to secure octavia to marry her son  consequently claudius broke off the engagement and forced silanus to resign from public office  silanus committed suicide on the day that agrippina married her uncle and calvina was exiled from italy in early 49  calvina was called back from exile after agrippina had died  towards the end of 54 agrippina would order the murder of silanus eldest brother marcus junius silanus torquatus without neros knowledge so that he wouldnt be able to seek revenge against her over his brothers death on the day that agrippina married her uncle claudius as her third husbandhis fourth wife she became an empress and the most powerful woman in the roman empire she also was a stepmother to claudia antonia claudius daughter and only child from his second marriage to aelia paetina and to the young claudia octavia and britannicus claudius children with valeria messalina agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court whom she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late messalina she also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son one of her victims being neros second paternal aunt and messalinas mother domitia lepida the younger in 49 agrippina presided over the exercises of roman legions the celtic king caratacus assumed that she along with claudius was the martial leader and bowed before her throne with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor in 50 agrippina was granted the honorific title of augusta a title which up until this point no other imperial woman had ever received in the lifetime of her husband she was only the third roman woman livia drusilla and antonia minor received this title and only the second living roman woman the first being livia to receive this title  also that year claudius had founded a roman colony and called the colony colonia claudia ara agrippinensis or agrippinensium today known as cologne after agrippina who was born there  this colony was the only roman colony to be named after a roman woman  in 51 she was given a carpentum which she used a carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests such as the vestal virgins and sacred statues  that same year she appointed sextus afranius burrus as the head of the praetorian guard replacing the previous head of the praetorian guard rufrius crispinus agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor  lucius domitius ahenobarbus in 50 was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather  lucius name was changed to nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus and he became claudiuss adopted son heir and recognised successor  agrippina and claudius betrothed nero to octavia and agrippina arranged to have seneca the younger return from exile to tutor the future emperor  claudius chose to adopt nero because of his julian and claudian lineage  agrippina deprived britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his biological father and succession for the throne in every way possible  for instance in 51 agrippina ordered the execution of britannicus tutor sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by claudius adoption of nero and his choice of nero as successor instead of choosing his own natural son britannicus although it should be noted that tiberius had chosen caligula as successor along with his grandson tiberius gemellus without any approbation at the time  caligula later had his cosuccessor killed nero and octavia were married on june 9 53  claudius later repented of marrying agrippina and adopting nero began to favor britannicus and started preparing him for the throne  this was the motive that is claimed by many that agrippina needed to eliminate claudius the ancient sources credited her with poisoning claudius on october 13 54 with a plate of poisoned mushrooms at a banquet thus enabling nero to quickly take the throne as emperor  accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources it is quite possible that claudius died of natural causes a more likely cause considering that he was 63 years old agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified claudius she was allowed to visit senate meetings watch and hear the meetings behind a curtain  this evidently shows that she had real power in the first months of neros reign agrippina controlled her son and the empire she lost control over nero when he began to have an affair with the freedwoman claudia acte which agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for  agrippina began to support britannicus in her attempt to make him emperor  britannicus was secretly poisoned on neros orders during a banquet in february 55  the power struggle between agrippina and her son had begun agrippina between 55 and 58 became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son  in 55 agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence  nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers and even removed her roman and german bodyguards  nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the greek island of rhodes a place where tiberius had lived after divorcing julia the elder pallas also was dismissed from the court the fall of pallas and the opposition of burrus and seneca contributed to agrippinas loss of authority towards 57 agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in misenum while agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to rome nero had sent people to annoy her  although living in misenum she was still very popular powerful and influential  agrippina and nero would see each other on short visits the circumstances that surround agrippinas death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and antinero bias   all surviving stories of agrippinas death contradict themselves and each other and are generally fantastical according to tacitus in 58 nero became involved with the noble woman poppaea sabina with the reasoning that a divorce from octavia and a marriage to poppaea was not politically feasible with agrippina alive nero decided to kill agrippina yet nero did not marry poppaea until 62 calling into question this motive   additionally suetonius reveals that poppaeas husband otho was not sent away by nero until after agrippinas death in 59 making it highly unlikely that already married poppaea would be pressing nero some modern historians theorize that neros decision to kill agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set gaius rubellius plautus neros maternal second cousin on the throne tacitus claims that nero considered poisoning or stabbing her but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious so he settled on building a selfsinking boat   though aware of the plot agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceilings fall  though the collapsing ceiling missed agrippina it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm  news of agrippinas survival reached nero so he sent three assassins to stab her according to suetonius nero was annoyed at his mother being too watchful and tried three times to poison agrippina but she took the antidotes in time and survived he then tried to crush her with a mechanical ceiling over her bed at her residence the tale of cassius dio is also somewhat different it starts again with poppaea as the motive behind the murder   nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea   agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up she fell into the water   nero then claimed agrippina plotted to kill him and committed suicide  her reputed last words uttered as the assassin was about to strike were smite my womb the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so abominable a son after agrippinas death nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was according to some  her body was cremated that night on a dining couch  at his mothers funeral nero was witless speechless and rather scared  when the news spread that agrippina had died the roman army senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had murdered his mother during the remainder of neros reign agrippinas grave was not covered or enclosed  her household later on gave her a modest tomb in misenum  nero would have his mothers death on his conscience he felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother he even saw his mothers ghost and got persian magicians to scare her away   years before she died agrippina had visited astrologers to ask about her sons future the astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her she replied let him kill me provided he becomes emperor according to tacitus handels 1709 opera agrippina with a libretto by vincenzo grimani', 'alexanderjannaeus his likely full hebrew name was jonathan he may have been the high priest jonathan rather than his greatuncle of the same name who established the masada fortress   under the name king yannai he appears as a wicked tyrant in the talmud reflecting his conflict with the pharisee party he is among the more colorful historical figures despite being little known outside specialized history he and his widow who became queen regnant after his death had substantial impact on the subsequent development of judaism jannaeus expanded the hasmonean kingdom and established the city of gamla in 81 bce as the capital for what is now the golan heights during the twentyseven year reign of alexander jannaeus he was almost constantly involved in military conflict   primarily international factors at the time created an environment suitable for jannaeus conquests  first of all jannaeus received support from cleopatra iii of egypt she was probably swayed to support jannaeus through two jewish commanders in her military   this support was particularly crucial during the war with ptolemy lathyrus discussed later  ultimately conflict in the roman empire was the greatest outside influence on judean military campaigns  political instability in rome led to a civil war beginning in 88 bce with rome chiefly concerned with a tumultuous domestic predicament jannaeus was free to expand the judean state   finally a weak seleucid empire was unable to help hellenistic cities near judea with a mercenary army similar to that of his father jannaeus led a judean army that conquered the entire coastal plain except for ashkelon jannaeus toppled western samaria the galilee and the northern transjordan the coastal ports of dor and caesarea were also taken after jannaeus was defeated at acre elsewhere on the mediterranean coast the judeans triumphed over the cities of raffah and antedon finally jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of gaza in a year long siege  this impressive victory gained judean control over the mediterranean outlet for the nabatean trade routes after a failed siege against gaza jannaeus struck a phony league of friendship with the egyptian coruler ptolemy lathyrus in reality jannaeus sought the assistance of lathyrus mother cleopatra iii against her son   when lathyrus learned of this treachery he took out his fury on judea after defeating jannaeus near the jordan river lathyrus soldiers slaughtered fleeing jewish troops  afterwards lathyrus attacked a small village in judea with utter malice the egyptian troops strangled women and children  then the deceased were cut into pieces boiled in cauldrons and eaten as a sacrifice  this act of cannibalism was used to terrify the judean people and their military   after this massacre jannaeus was in no position to stop the onslaught of lathyrus however cleopatra iii stepped in to prevent lathyrus from sacking jerusalem news of this slaughter certainly spread rapidly throughout judea exemplified by the pesher on isaiah 4q161 found at qumran it is clear that a strong rift existed between the pharisees and alexander jannaeus the rival sadducees were avid supporters of jannaeus see 4q448  the pharisaic opposition to jannaeus continued with his marriage to his brothers widow which was forbidden by torah law   furthermore jannaeus established himself as a ruler concerned mainly with conquests rather than his religious obligations one year during the jewish holiday of sukkot alexander jannaeus while officiating as the high priest kohen gadol at the temple in jerusalem demonstrated his support of the sadducees by denying the law of the water libation the crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting alexander with the etrogim citrons that they were holding in their hands  unwittingly the crowd had played right into alexanders hands he had intended to incite the people to riot and his soldiers fell upon the crowd at his command the soldiers slew more than 6000 people in the temple courtyard this incident during tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the judean civil war by igniting popular opponents of jannaeus a qumran document sheds further light on another opponent of jannaeus the scroll 4q390 was written by an adversary of jannaeus seeking popular support to overthrow the hasmonean king the author called for an end to the dispute between jannaeus and the pharisees according to the author the only acceptable solution was an end to the hasmonean priesthood and secular control   this opposition culminated in the judean civil war the judean civil war initially began after the conquest of gaza by jannaeus due to jannaeus victory at gaza the nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their trade routes to rome and damascus therefore nabatean king obodas i launched an attack on judea in the golan potentially the war with the nabateans was the last straw against a warmongering king and an incompetent high priest after jannaeus was defeated in battle against obadas he returned to fierce jewish opposition in jerusalem a civil war broke out between pharisaic supported jewish rebels and jannaeus overall the war lasted six years and left 50000 judeans dead  after jannaeus succeeded early in the war the rebels unbelievably asked for seleucid assistance  judean insurgents joined forces with demetrius iii to fight against jannaeus the seleucid forces defeated jannaeus at schechem and forced him into exile in the mountains   however these judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible jewish king than backtrack to a seleucid ruler   after 6000 jews returned to jannaeus demetrius was defeated the end of the civil war brought a sense of national solidarity against seleucid influence   nevertheless jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the judean state the aftermath of the judean civil war consisted of popular unrest poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides the greatest impact of the war was the victors revenge  josephus reports that jannaeus brought 800 rebels to jerusalem and had them crucified   even worse jannaeus had the throats of the rebels wives and children cut before their eyes as jannaeus ate with his concubines this incredible account is supported in the dead sea scrolls in the nahum pesher the judean civil war and jannaeus brutal retribution are specifically mentioned in this passage the seekersaftersmooththings represent the jewish rebels the lion of wrath represents alexander jannaeus and the rulers of kittim signify the roman empire given that this passage mentions the roman takeover it was clearly written after the fall of the hasmonean dynasty nevertheless substantiation of josephus account of the crucifixion of jewish rebels by jannaeus quells any doubt of historicity of this event the coinage of alexander jannaeus is characteristic of the early jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations in opposition to the surrounding greek and later roman types of the period  jewish coinage instead focused on symbols either natural such as the palm tree the pomegranate or the star or manmade such as the temple the menorah trumpets or cornucopia alexander jannaeus was the first of the jewish kings to introduce the eightray star or eightspoked wheel symbol in his bronze widows mite coins in combination with the widespread seleucid numismatic symbol of the anchor  these coins are thought to be the ones referred to in the bible in luke 2114 depending on the make the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle in a style rather indicative of a wheel  on others the spokes can have a more flamelike shape more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem it is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize and interpretations vary from the morning star to the sun or the heavens the influence of some persian symbols of a star within a diadem or the eightspoked buddhist wheel see the coins of the indogreek king menander i with this symbol have also been suggested the eightspoked macedonian star a variation of which is the vergina sun emblem of the royal argead dynasty and the ancient kingdom of macedonia within a hellenistic diadem symbolizing royalty many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem seem to be the most probable source for this symbol the most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation  biblical law forbids the making of graven images especially see deuteronomy 41623 yet the image of a monarch is a staple of hellenistic coins  in place of an image of himself therefore it is likely that alexander jannaeus chose a star in keeping with numbers 2417 a star rises from jacob a scepter comes forth from israel this verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy and specifically as support for a davidic monarchy  jannaeus however could have seen it as an image of his achievements if not his own rule  this is how the rest of numbers 2417 and verses 18 and 19 continue   the star it says smashes the brow of moab the foundation of all children of seth edom becomes a possession yea seir a possession of its enemies but israel is triumphant a victor issues from jacob to wipe out what is left of ir considering jannaeus conquestscreating a kingdom that rivaled those of david and solomon and may have even exceeded thosethe star envisioned in the prophecy of balaam in numbers was a perfect match for him alexander jannaeus is the main character of the novel the king of flesh and blood by israeli novelist moshe shamir', 'afonsovofportugal he was born in sintra the eldest son of king edward of portugal by his wife infanta eleanor of aragon afonso v was only six years old when he succeeded his father in 1438 during his minority afonso v was placed under the regency of his mother according to a late will of his father  as both a foreigner and a woman the queen was not a popular choice for regent  opposition rose and the queens only ally was afonso count of barcelos the illegitimate half brother of king edward and count of barcelos in the following year the cortes assembly of the kingdom decided to replace the queen with infante peter duke of coimbra the young kings oldest uncle  his main policies were concerned with avoiding the development of great noble houses kingdoms inside the kingdom and concentrating power in the person of the king the country prospered under his rule but not peacefully as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles the count of barcelos a personal enemy of the duke of coimbra despite being halfbrothers eventually became the kings favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power  in 1442 the king made afonso the first duke of braganza with this title and its lands he became the most powerful man in portugal and one of the richest men in europe to secure his position as regent in 1445 peter had afonso marry his daughter isabella of coimbra but in  9 june 1448 when the king came of age peter had to surrender his power to afonso v  the years of conspiracy by the duke of braganza finally came to a head  on 15 september of the same year afonso v nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency the situation became unstable and in the following year being led by what he afterwards discovered to be false representations afonso declared peter a rebel and defeated his army in the battle of alfarrobeira in which both his uncle and father in law was killed  after this battle and the loss of one of portugals most remarkable infantes the duke of braganza became the de facto ruler of the country afonso v then turned his attentions to the north of africa in his grandfathers reign ceuta had been conquered from the king of morocco now the new king wanted to expand the conquests the kings army conquered alccer ceguer 1458 tangiers won and lost several times between 1460 and 1464 and arzila 1471  this achievements granted the king the nickname of the african the king also supported the exploration of the atlantic ocean led by prince henry the navigator but after henrys death in 1460 he did nothing to pursue this course of action  administratively afonso v was an absent king since he did not pursue development of laws or commerce preferring to stand with the legacy of his father and grandfather in 1452 pope nicholas v issued the papal bull dum diversas granting afonso v the right to reduce any saracens pagans and any other unbelievers to hereditary slavery  this approval of slavery was reaffirmed and extended in the romanus pontifex bull of 1455 also by nicholas v these papal bulls came to serve as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and european colonialism when the campaigns in africa were over afonso v found new grounds for battle in the iberian peninsula in neighbouring castile a huge scandal with political and dynastic implications had arisen  king henry iv of castile died without a male heir  from his two marriages only a daughter joan princess of castile had been born but her paternity was questioned as rumour said the king was impotent and the queen joan of portugal had a notorious affair with a nobleman called beltrn de la cueva the birth of princess joan in 1462 openly called the beltraneja caused the separation of her parents she was never considered legitimate and when the king was dying no one took her as a serious contender for the crown  her halfaunt the future queen isabella i of castile was due to inherit the crown but afonso v was keen to interfere with the succession in castile in 1475 he married his niece joan the beltraneja whom he considered the legitimate heir to the crown  since her adulteress mother was his own sister afonso v had not only ambition but the family honour to protect he proclaimed himself king of castile and len and prepared to defend his wifes rights  in the following year he was defeated at the battle of toro by king ferdinand v of castile the husband of isabella i of castile he went to france to obtain the assistance of louis xi but finding himself deceived by the french monarch he returned to portugal in 1477 in very low spirits  disillusioned and depressed he fell into a deep melancholy and abdicated in favour of his son john ii after this he retired to a monastery in sintra where he died in 1481  his death was mourned in the country by the people who loved the king  and by the nobles who were starting to fear his successor afonso married first to his cousin isabella of coimbra in 1447  isabella died in 1455 and afonso married again although not recognized by the papacy in 1475 this time to joan of castile known as la beltraneja daughter of henry iv of castile and joan of portugal this marriage was an attempt to inherit the throne of castile as joan was the sole daughter of henry iv however this didnt happen as afonso lost a short war with

quapaw a related kaw tribe word akakaze meaning land of downriver people or the sioux word akakaze meaning people of the south wind the pronunciation of arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881 after a dispute between the two us senators from arkansas one wanted to pronounce the name   and the other wanted citizens of the state of kansas often pronounce the arkansas river as  in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state in 2007 the state legislature officially declared the possessive form of the states name to be arkansass the mississippi river forms most of arkansass eastern border except in clay and greene counties where the st francis river forms the western boundary of the missouri bootheel and in dozens of places where the current channel of the mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified   arkansas shares its southern border with louisiana its northern border with missouri its eastern border with tennessee and mississippi and its western border with texas and oklahoma arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys thick forests and fertile plains the socalled lowlands are better known by names of their two regions the delta and the grand prairie the arkansas delta is a flat landscape of rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding of the adjacent mississippi farther away from the river in the southeast portion of the state the grand prairie consists of a more undulating landscape  both are fertile agricultural areas the delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as crowleys ridge a narrow band of rolling hills crowleys ridge rises from 250 to convert500 above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern arkansas northwest arkansas is part of the ozark plateau including the boston mountains to the south are the ouachita mountains and these regions are divided by the arkansas river the southern and

lows are convert44 and convert23  annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about convert40 somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state  snowfall is common moreso in the north half of the state which usually gets several snowfalls each winter  this is not only due to its closer proximity to the plains states but also to the higher elevations found throughout the ozark and ouachita mountains the half of the state south of little rock gets less snow and is more apt to see ice storms however sleet and freezing rain are expected throughout the state during the winter months and can significantly impact travel and day to day life arkansas is known for extreme weather a typical year will see thunderstorms tornadoes hail snow and ice storms  between both the great plains and the gulf states arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms a few of the most destructive tornadoes in us history have struck the state  while being

spawns smaller tornadoes high water pouring down the white river caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern arkansas the first european to reach arkansas was the spanish explorer hernando de soto a veteran of pizarros conquest of peru who died near lake village on the mississippi river in 1542 after almost a year traversing the southern part of the state in search of gold and a passage to china arkansas is one of several us states formed from the territory purchased from napoleon bonaparte in the louisiana purchase the early spanish or french explorers of the state gave it its name which is probably a phonetic spelling of the illinois tribes name for the quapaw people who lived downriver from them  other native american tribes who lived in arkansas before  moving west were the cherokee quapaw caddo and osage nations  in their forced move westward under us indian removal policies the five civilized tribes inhabited arkansas during its territorial period the territory of arkansas arkansas played a key role in aiding texas in its war for independence from mexico it sent troops and materials to texas to help fight the war the proximity of the city of washington to the texas border involved the town in the texas revolution of 183536  some evidence suggests sam houston and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at washington in 1834  when the fighting began a stream of volunteers from arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the texas battle fields when the mexicanamerican war began in 1846 washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops  governor thomas s drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the united states army ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first regiment of arkansas cavalry the state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the mississippi delta this was where enslaved labor was used most extensively as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the upper south on the eve of the civil war in 1860 enslaved african americans numbered 111115 people just over 25 of the states population arkansas refused to join the confederate states of america until after united states president abraham lincoln called for troops to respond to the confederate attack upon fort sumter south carolina the state of arkansas declared its secession from the union on may 6 1861  while not often cited in historical accounts the state was the scene of numerous smallscale battles during the american civil war arkansans of note who contributed to the civil war included confederate major general patrick cleburne considered by many to be one of the most brilliant confederate division commanders of the war cleburne was often referred to as the stonewall of the west also of note was major general thomas c hindman a former united states representative hindman commanded confederate forces at the battle of cane hill and battle of prairie grove under the military reconstruction act congress restored arkansas to the union in june 1868  the reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage while disenfranchising former confederates mostly democrats a public education system and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population the state came under almost exclusive control of radical republicans those who emigrated from the north being derided as carpetbaggers by exconfederates based on allegations of corruption led by newly elected governor powell clayton marking a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between state militia and the ku klux klan in 1874 the brooksbaxter war a political struggle between factions of the republican party shook little rock and the state governorship it was settled only when president ulysses s grant ordered joseph brooks to disperse his militant supporters following the brooksbaxter war a new state constitution was ratified reenfranchising former confederates in 1881 the arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the states name to combat a controversy then simmering  see law and government below after reconstruction the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants  chinese italian and syrian men were recruited for farm labor in the developing delta region  none of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor the chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the delta some early 20th century immigration included people from eastern europe together these immigrants made the delta more diverse than the rest of the state  in the same years some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property  many chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market it also brought new development into different parts of the state including the ozarks where some areas were developed as resorts  in a few years at the end of the 19th century for instance eureka springs in carroll county grew to 10000 people rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state it featured newly constructed elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs considered to have healthful properties the towns attractions included horse racing and other entertainment it appealed to a wide variety of classes becoming almost as popular as hot springs in the late 1880s the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed populist and third party movements leading to interracial coalitions  struggling to stay in power in the 1890s the democrats in arkansas followed other southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites  democrats wanted to prevent their alliance  in 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded at a time when more than 25 of the population could neither read nor write  in 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a poll tax and more complex residency requirements both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers and forced them from electoral rolls by 1900 the democratic party expanded use of the white primary in county and state elections further denying blacks a part in the political process  only in the primary was there any competition among candidates as democrats held all the power the state was a democratic oneparty state for decades until after the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 were passed between 1905 and 1911 arkansas began to receive a small migration of german slovak and irish immigrants the german and slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the prairie and the irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state the germans were mostly catholic and the slovaks were lutheran the irish were mostly protestant from ulster after the supreme courts decision in brown v board of education of topeka kansas in 1954 the little rock nine

ordered the arkansas national guard to aid segregationists in preventing nine africanamerican students from enrolling at little rocks central high school after attempting three times to contact faubus president dwight d eisenhower sent 1000 troops from the activeduty 101st airborne division to escort and protect the africanamerican students as they entered school on september 25 1957  in defiance

states electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates  arkansas has become more reliably republican in presidential elections in recent years the state voted for john mccain in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points making it one of the few states in the country to vote more republican than it had in 2004  the others were louisiana tennessee oklahoma and west virginia obamas relatively poor showing in arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state democrats following former arkansas first lady hillary clintons failure to win the nomination and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters however the democratic presence remains strong on the state level in 2006 democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a democratic sweep that included the democratic party of arkansas regaining the governorship and in 2008 freshman senator mark pryor was reelected with nearly 80 of the vote against green candidate

terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years effective with the 1986 general election   statewide elections are held two years after presidential elections some of arkansass counties have two county seats as opposed to the usual one seat the arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state the seats are usually on opposite sides of the county  though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists since the county seat is a source of pride and jobs to the city involved arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law arkansaw article 19 miscellaneous provisions item 1 in the arkansas constitution is entitled atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness and states that no person who denies the being of a god shall hold any office in the civil departments of this state nor be competent to testify as a witness in

village of the republic of venice situated amid the recesses of the hills of asolo where these form the last undulations of the venetian alps as they subside into the plains of treviso at three years of age canova was deprived of both parents his father dying and his mother remarrying  their loss however was compensated by the tender solicitude and care of his paternal grandfather and grandmother the latter of whom lived to experience in her turn the kindest personal attention from her grandson who when he had the means gave her an asylum in his house at rome his father and grandfather followed the occupation of stonecutters or minor statuaries and it is said that their family had for several ages supplied possagno with members of that calling  as soon as canovas hand could hold a pencil he was initiated into the principles of drawing by his grandfather pasino the latter possessed some knowledge both of drawing and of architecture designed well and showed considerable taste in the execution of ornamental works he was greatly attached to his art and upon his young charge he looked as one who was to perpetuate not only the family name but also the family profession the early years of canova were passed in study the bias of his mind was to sculpture and the facilities afforded for the gratification of this predilection in the workshop of his grandfather were eagerly improved  in his ninth year he executed two small shrines of carrara marble which are still extant  soon after this period he appears to have been constantly employed under his grandfather  amongst those who patronized the old man was the patrician family falier of venice and by this means young canova was first introduced to the senator of that name who afterwards became his most zealous patron between the younger son giuseppe falier and the artist a friendship commenced which terminated only with life the senator falier was induced to receive him under his immediate protection it has been related by an italian writer and since repeated by several biographers that canova was indebted to a trivial circumstance  the moulding of a lion in butter  for the warm interest which falier took in his welfare the anecdote may or may not be true  by his patron canova was placed under bernardi or as he is generally called by filiation giuseppe torretto a sculptor of considerable eminence who had taken up a temporary residence at pagnano one of asolos boroughs this took place whilst canova was in his thirteenth year and with torretto he continued about two years making in many respects considerable progress  this master returned to venice where he soon afterwards died but by the high terms in which he spoke of his pupil to falier the latter was induced to bring the young artist to venice whither he accordingly went and was placed under a nephew of torretto with this instructor he continued about a year studying with the utmost assiduity after the termination of this engagement he began to work on his own account and received from his patron an order for a group orpheus and eurydice the first figure which represents eurydice in flames and smoke in the act of leaving hades was completed towards the close of his sixteenth year it was highly esteemed by his patron and friends and the artist was now considered qualified to appear before a public tribunal the kindness of some monks supplied him with his first workshop which was the vacant cell of a monastery  here for nearly four years he labored with the greatest perseverance and industry he was also regular in his attendance at the academy where he carried off several prizes but he relied far more on the study and imitation of nature a large portion of his time was also devoted to anatomy which science was regarded by him as the secret of the art he likewise frequented places of public amusement where he carefully studied the expressions and attitudes of the performers he formed a resolution which was faithfully adhered to for several years never to close his eyes at night without having produced some design  whatever was likely to forward his advancement in sculpture he studied with ardour  on archaeological pursuits he bestowed considerable attention  with ancient and modern history he rendered himself well acquainted and he also began to acquire some of the continental languages three years had now elapsed without any production coming from his chisel he began however to complete the group for his patron and the orpheus which followed evinced the great advance he had made the work was universally applauded and laid the foundation of his fame  several groups succeeded this performance amongst which was that of daedalus and icarus the most celebrated work of his noviciate the terseness of style and the faithful imitation of nature which characterized them called forth the warmest admiration  his merits and reputation being now generally recognized his thoughts began to turn from the shores of the adriatic to the banks of the tiber for which he set out at the commencement of his twentyfourth year before his departure for rome his friends had applied to the venetian senate for a pension to enable him to pursue his studies without embarrassment the application was ultimately successful the stipend amounted to three hundred ducats about 60 pounds per annum and was limited to three years  canova had obtained letters of introduction to the venetian ambassador the cavaliere zulian and enlightened and generous protector of the arts and was received in the most hospitable manner his arrival in rome on 28 december 1780 marks a new era in his life it was here he was to perfect himself by a study of the most splendid relics of antiquity and to put his talents to the severest test by a competition with the living masters of the art the result was equal to the highest hopes cherished either by himself or by his friends the work which first established his fame at rome was theseus vanquishing the minotaur now in the collections of the victoria  albert museum in london the figures are of the heroic size the victorious theseus is represented as seated on the lifeless body of the monster the exhaustion which visibly pervades his whole frame proves the terrible nature of the conflict in which he has been engaged  simplicity and natural expression had hitherto characterized canovas style with these were now united more exalted conceptions of grandeur and of truth the theseus was regarded with fervent admiration canovas next undertaking was a monument in honor of clement xiv but before he proceeded with it he deemed it necessary to request permission from the venetian senate whose servant he considered himself to be in consideration of the pension  this he solicited in person and it was granted he returned immediately to rome and opened his celebrated studio close to the via del babuino he spent about two years of unremitting toil in arranging the design and composing the models for the tomb of the pontiff  after these were completed other two years were employed in finishing the monument and it was finally opened to public inspection in 1787  the work in the opinion of enthusiastic dilettanti stamped the author as the first artist of modern times after five years of incessant labor he completed another cenotaph to the memory of clement xiii which raised his fame still higher  works now came rapidly from his chisel  amongst these is psyche with a butterfly which is placed on the left hand and held by the wings with the right  this figure which is intended as a personification of mans immaterial part is considered as in almost every respect the most faultless and classical of canovas works  in two different groups and with opposite expression the sculptor has represented cupid with his bride in the one they are standing in the other recumbent  these and other works raised his reputation so high that the most flattering offers were sent to him from the russian court to induce him to remove to st petersburg but these were declined although many of his finest works made their way to the hermitage museum italy says he in writing of the occurrence to a friend italy is my country  is the country and native soil of the arts i cannot leave her my infancy was nurtured here if my poor talents can be useful in any other land they must be of some utility to italy and ought not her claim to be preferred to all others numerous works were produced in the years 17951797 of which several were repetitions of previous productions  one was the celebrated group representing the parting of venus and adonis this famous production was sent to naples the french revolution was now extending its shocks over italy and canova sought obscurity and repose in his native possagno thither he retired in 1798 and there he continued for about a year principally employed in painting of which art also he had some knowledge  events in the political world having come to a temporary lull he returned to rome but his health being impaired from arduous application he took a journey through a part of germany in company with his friend prince rezzonico he returned from his travels much improved and again commenced his labors with vigour and enthusiasm the events which marked the life of the artist during the first fifteen years of the period in which he was engaged on the abovementioned works scarcely merit notice  his mind was entirely absorbed in the labors of his studio and with the exception of his journeys to paris one to vienna and a few short intervals of absence in florence and other parts of italy he never quit rome in his own words his statues were the sole proofs of his civil existence in the autumn of this year he gratified a wish he had long entertained of visiting london where he received the highest tokens of esteem the artist for whom he showed particular sympathy and regard in london was benjamin haydon who might at the time be counted the sole representative of historical painting there and whom he especially honored for his championship of the elgin marbles then recently transported to england and ignorantly depreciated by polite connoisseurs  among canovas english pupils were sculptors sir richard westmacott and john gibson canova returned to rome in the beginning of 1816 with the ransomed spoils of his countrys genius  immediately after he received several marks of distinction he was made president of the accademia di san luca the main artistic institution in rome and by the hand of the pope himself his name was inscribed in the golden volume of the capitol and he received the title of marquis of ischia with an annual pension of 3000 crowns he now contemplated a great work a colossal statue of religion the model filled italy with admiration the marble was procured and the chisel of the sculptor ready to be applied to it when the jealousy of churchmen as to the site or some other cause deprived the country of the projected work the mind of canova was inspired with the warmest sense of devotion and though foiled in this instance he resolved to consecrate a shrine to the cause  in his native village he began to make preparations for erecting a temple which was to contain not only the above statue but other works of his own within its precincts were to repose also the ashes of the founder  accordingly he repaired to possagno in 1819  after the foundationstone of this edifice had been laid canova returned to rome but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit possagno in order to direct the workmen and encourage them with pecuniary rewards and medals in the meantime the vast expenditure exhausted his resources and compelled him to labor with unceasing assiduity notwithstanding age and disease  during the period which intervened between commencing operations at possagno and his decease he executed or finished some of his most striking works  amongst these were the group mars and venus the colossal figure of pius vi the piet the st john the recumbent magdalen the last performance which issued from his hand was a colossal bust of his friend the count cicognara in may 1822 he paid a visit to naples to superintend the construction of wax moulds for an equestrian statue of the perjured bourbon king ferdinand vii this journey materially injured his health but he rallied again on his return to rome towards the latter end of the year he paid his annual visit to the place of his birth when he experienced a relapse he proceeded to venice and expired there at the age of nearly sixtyfive  his disease was one which had affected him from an early age caused by the continual use of carvingtools producing a depression of the ribs the most distinguished funeral honors were paid to his remains which were deposited in the temple at possagno on 25 october 1822  his heart was interred in a marble pyramid he designed as a mausoleum for the painter titian in the church of santa maria gloriosa dei frari in venice now a monument to the sculptor among canovas heroic compositions his perseus with the head of medusa photo right appeared soon after his return from germany the moment of representation is when the hero flushed with conquest displays the head of the snaky gorgon whilst the right hand grasps a sword of singular device  by a public decree this fine work was placed in one of the stanze of the vatican hitherto reserved for the most precious works of antiquity in 1802 at the personal request of napoleon canova returned to paris to model a bust of the first consul the artist was entertained with munificence and various honors were conferred upon him the statue which is colossal and entitled napoleon as mars the peacemaker was not finished till four years after  on the fall of the great emperor louis xviii presented this statue to the british government by whom it was afterwards given to the duke of wellington under the head of compositions of grace and elegance the statue of hebe takes the first place in point of date  four times has the artist embodied in stone the goddess of youth and each time with some variation the last one is in the museum of forl in italy the only material improvement however is the substitution of a support more suitable to the simplicity of the art  each of the statues is in all its details in expression attitude and delicacy of finish strikingly elegant thumbrightpauline bonaparte as venus victrix now at the galleria borghese the dancing nymphs maintain a character similar to that of the hebe the three graces and the venus are more elevated the awakened nymph is another work of uncommon beauty the mother of napoleon his consort maria louise as concord to model whom the author made a further journey to paris in 1810 the princess esterhazy and the muse polymnia elisa bonaparte take their place in this class as do the ideal heads comprising corinna sappho laura beatrice and helen of troy of the cenotaphs and funeral monuments the most splendid is the monument to the archduchess maria christina duchess of teschen consisting of nine figures besides the two for the roman pontiffs already mentioned there is one for alfieri another for emo a venetian admiral and a small model of a cenotaph for horatio nelson besides a great variety of monumental relieves such as the stele tadini in the chapel of the accademia tadini in lovere george anthony legh keck was known to have collected some of antonio canovas sculptures and had them on display at his jacobean mansion house of bank hall in bretherton after the death of legh keck in 1860 the sculptures where auctioned off their whereabouts is unknown', 'arizonadiamondbacks the arizona diamondbacks are a professional baseball team based in phoenix arizona they play in the west division of major league baseballs national league from 1998 to the present they have played in chase field formerly bank one ballpark also known as the dbacks arizona has one world series title in 2001 becoming the fastest expansion team in the majors to win a championship doing it in only the fourth season since their expansion in 1998 between 1940 and 1990 phoenix jumped from the 99th largest city in the nation to the 9th largest it is currently the 5th largest  as such it was frequently mentioned as a possible location for either a new or relocated mlb franchise  baseball had a rich tradition in arizona long before talk of bringing a bigleague team even started the state has been a frequent spring training site since 1946  with a large number of people relocating to the state from the midwest and the northeast as well as from california many teams most notably the chicago cubs and the los angeles dodgers have normally had large followings in arizona the first serious attempt to land an expansion team for the phoenix area was mounted by elyse doherty and martin stone owner of the phoenix firebirds the citys triplea minor league baseball team and the top affiliate of the san francisco giants in the late 1980s stone approached st louis football cardinals owner bill bidwill about sharing a proposed 70000 seat domed stadium in phoenix it was taken for granted that a domed stadium was a must for a majorleague team to be a viable venture in the phoenix area  phoenix is by far the hottest major city in north america the average high temperature during baseballs regular season is 991 f and gametime temperatures well above 100f are very common during the summer the gametime temperature has topped 120f in july and august three times since the diamondbacks inception bidwill with plans already in the works to leave st louis opted instead to sign a long term lease with arizona state university to use its sun devil stadium as the home of his soontobe arizonabased nfl franchise  since baseballonly stadiums were not seen as fiscally viable during that era this effectively ended stones bid in the fall of 1993 jerry colangelo majority owner of the phoenix suns the areas nba franchise announced he was assembling an ownership group arizona baseball inc to apply for a major league baseball expansion team  this was after a great deal of lobbying by the maricopa county sports authority a local group formed to preserve cactus league spring training in arizona and eventually secure a major league franchise for the state colangelos group was so certain that they would be awarded a franchise that they held a nametheteam contest for it they took out a fullpage ad in the sports section of the february 13 1995 edition of the states leading newspaper the arizona republic first prize was a pair of lifetime season tickets awarded to the person who submitted the winning entry the winning choice was diamondbacks after the western diamondback a rattlesnake native to the region known for injecting a large amount of venom when it strikes colangelos bid received strong support from one of his friends chicago white sox and chicago bulls owner jerry reinsdorf and media reports say that thenacting commissioner of baseball and milwaukee brewers founder bud selig was also a strong supporter of colangelos bid  plans were also made for a new retractableroof ballpark bank one ballpark nicknamed the bob renamed in 2005 to chase field to be built in an industrialwarehouse district on the southeast edge of downtown phoenix across the street from the suns america west arena now us airways center on march 9 1995 colangelos group was awarded a franchise to begin play for the 1998 season a 130million franchise fee was paid to major league baseball the tampa bay area was also granted a franchise the devil rays to be based in st petersburg at the same time according to the original press release from colangelos group which remained posted on the team website during the first few seasons the chosen team colors were arizona turquoise copper black and purpleturquoise was chosen because the greenishblue stone is indigenous to arizona copper because arizona is one the nations top copperproducing states and purple because it has become a favorite color for arizona sports fans thanks to the success of the national basketball associations phoenix suns in the earliest days the diamondbacks operated basically as a subsidiary of the suns several executives and managers with the suns and america west arena were brought over to the diamondbacks in similar roles from the beginning colangelo wanted to market the diamondbacks to a statewide fan base and not limit fan appeal to phoenix and its suburbs  although every major league baseball team cultivates fans from outside its immediate metropolitan area and even though the greater phoenix area has 23 of the statewide population colangelo still decided to call the team the arizona diamondbacks rather than the phoenix diamondbacks many in phoenix were not pleased by this they felt this move lent a small market tincture to the teams name  however fans in other areas of the state generally agreed with the move a series of teamsponsored fan motorcoach trips from tucson to bank one ballpark were inaugurated for the opening season and are still in operation to this day it is now known as the diamond express the diamondbacks are also known for the hometown tour held in january where selected players management and broadcasters make public appearances hold autograph signings etc in various locations around phoenix and tucson as well as many small and midsized towns in other areas of arizona two years before their first opening day colangelo hired buck showalter the american league manager of the year in 1994 with the new york yankees their lower level minor league baseball teams began play in 1997 the expansion draft was held that year as well the diamondbacks first major league game was played against the colorado rockies on march 31 1998 at bank one ballpark before a standingroom only crowd of 50179  tickets had gone on sale on january 10 and sold out before lunch the rockies won 92 with andy benes on the mound for the diamondbacks and travis lee being the first player to hit score homer and drive in a run in their first five seasons of existence the diamondbacks won three division titles 1999 2001 2002 and one world series 2001  in 1999 arizona won 100 games in only its second season to win the nl west title they lost to the new york mets in four games in the nlds colangelo fired showalter after a relatively disappointing 2000 season and replaced him with bob brenly the former giants catcher and coach who had up to that point been working as a color analyst on diamondbacks television broadcasts in 2001 the team was led by two of the most dominant pitchers in all of baseball  randy johnson and curt schilling arizona had postseason victories over the st louis cardinals 32 in the nlds and the atlanta braves 41 in the nlcs to advance to the world series where in in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york city they beat the reigning champions the new york yankees 4 to 3 to become the youngest expansion franchise to win the world series in just their fourth season of play  this was the first time since  that the home team won all seven games of a world series and the first time that a national league team won a world series in which the home team won all seven games of a world series an estimated orderly crowd of over 300000 celebrated at the diamondbacks victory parade held at bank one ballpark and the surrounding downtown phoenix streets on november 7 2001  this was the first major professional sports championship for the state of arizona and the first for a team in the four major north american professional sports leagues owned or controlled by colangelo whose basketball suns made it to the nba finals in 1976 and 1993 but lost both times  colangelos arizona rattlers won the arena football league championship in 1994 and 1997 colangelos willingness to go into debt and acquire players through free agency would ultimately lead to one of the quickest free falls in major sports history when in just three years the diamondbacks would record one of the worst losing records in all of major league baseball by losing 111 games the team won the nl west division title again in 2002 but were swept out in the nlds by the st louis cardinals by the 2004 season however the diamondbacks had dropped to a dismal 51111 record the worst in major league baseball that year and also one of the 10 worst records in the past 100years of mlb despite johnson pitching a perfect game on may 18 of that season  brenly was fired partway through the season and was replaced on an interim basis by coach al pedrique before the season comvp with johnson of the 2001 world series curt schilling had been traded to the boston red sox who won the world series in 2004 and 2007 by this time colangelo and the other partners were embroiled in a dispute over the financial health and direction of the diamondbacks and notably including over 150million in deferred compensation to many players who were key members of the 2001 world series winning team and others he was forced to resign his managing general partner post in the late summer of 2004 colangelo sold his interest in the general partnership of the diamondbacks to a group of investors who were all involved as partners in the founding of the team in 1995  the investors include equal partners ken kendrick mike chipman and jeffrey royer jeff moorad a former sports agent joined the partnership and was named the teams ceo becoming its primary public face  ken kendrick became the managing general partner colangelo was sharply criticized for plunging the team into over 150million in debt to secure the services of expensive veterans in order to field a competitive team quickly  in a 2004 interview with columnist hal bodley of usa today colangelo defended his actions also a factor in colangelos leaving his post was his advancing age  colangelo was 64years of age in 2004 and had he not sold his sports franchises upon his death his family would have been faced with having to pay high estate taxes based on the value of the diamondbacks as well as the suns which he sold to robert sarver in the spring of 2004 following the 2004 season the diamondbacks hired wally backman to be the teams manager  backman was formerly manager of the class a california league lancaster jethawks one of the diamondbacks minorleague affiliates  in a turn of events that proved to be a minor embarrassment for the reorganized ownership group backman was almost immediately fired after management learned after the fact of legal troubles and improprieties in backmans past  former seattle mariners manager and diamondbacks bench coach bob melvin became the new manager after only a tenday tenure for backman following the backman incident the diamondbacks spent heavily on free agents in order to rebuild into a contender the club signed 3b troy glaus p russ ortiz ss royce clayton and 2b craig counsell among others they then traded randy johnson to the new york yankees for javier vazquez dioner navarro and brad halsey they then turned around and dealt newly acquired catcher dioner navarro to the dodgers for shawn green and sent shea hillenbrand to the toronto blue jays finally they traded casey fossum to the tampa bay devil rays for jos cruz jr the diamondbacks led by melvin finished the 2005 season with a record of 77 wins and 85 losses  however this was a 26game improvement over 2004 and actually good enough for second place in the woefully weak nl west five games behind the san diego padres the diamondbacks were considered by some to be the favorite to win the division after spending big money on the aforementioned free agents however injuries hurt the teams chances of reaching its expected potential starting pitcher ortiz was out for some time which really hurt the pitching staff  glaus played with a hurt knee all season  of all the free agents that signed before the season no one had a better season than first baseman tony clark clark started the season as a bench player and ended the season starting and being an important part of the team  clark was rewarded with a new contract at the end of the season in october 2005 the diamondbacks hired 35yearold josh byrnes assistant general manager of the boston red sox to replace the outgoing joe garagiola jr as diamondbacks general manager garagiola took a position in major league baseballs main offices in new york city in a weak nl west division the diamondbacks failed to improve on their 2005 performance finishing fourth with a slightly worse record than the year before the season did include two excellent individual performances however 2b orlando hudson became the recipient of his second career gold glove award as announced on november 3  hudson became only the sixth infielder in major league history to win a gold glove award in both the american and national leagues he first received the award after the 2005 season as a member of the toronto blue jays and was traded to the diamondbacks later that offseason  on november 14 it was announced that rhp brandon webb was the recipient of the cy young award for the national league webb a specialist in throwing the sinkerball received 15 of 32 firstplace votes in balloting by the baseball writers association of america webb went 168 with a 310 era and in the 2006 season was named to his first allstar team  san diego padres relief pitcher trevor hoffman was second place in the voting with 12 firstplace votes and 77 points in preparation for the next season the diamondbacks made several significant trades during the offseason the diamondbacks and brewers made a trade on november 25 2006  johnny estrada greg aquino and claudio vargas were dealt to the milwaukee brewers for doug davis dana eveland and dave krynzel on sunday january 7 it was announced that randy johnson would return to the diamondbacks on a two year contract pending a physical he was obtained from the yankees in exchange for luis vizcaino ross ohlendorf alberto gonzalez and steven jackson the yankees will pay 2million of johnsons 26million salary the diamondbacks and florida marlins made a deal march 26 to acquire rhp yusmeiro petit in exchange for jorge julio and cash the diamondbacks announced in early september 2006 that their uniforms which remained largely unchanged since the teams first season would be completely redesigned for the 2007 season  details were supposed to be kept from the public until after the 2006 postseason as per mlb rules but the diamondback page from the 2007 mlb official style guide was somehow leaked around september 25 and local media broadcast printed the new design for all to see  of great surprise to many fans was a brand new color scheme apparently the original colors used by the franchise since major league baseball awarded it to jerry colangelos ownership group in 1995 were to be discontinued while some fans applauded the redesign most of the reaction to the new color scheme which included the changing of the historical purple and traditional arizonan colors of copper and turquoise to a reddish color known as sedona red similar to that of the phoenix coyotes and arizona cardinals color schemes was pointedly negative many fans went so far as to call the 2007 dbacks a new and completely different team calling the 2007 season a reinaugural year some fans in tucson had banners reading arizona diamondbacks 19982006  arizona dbacks 2007  or exit diamondbacks enter dbacks and exit purple enter sedona the official unveiling of the uniforms came at a charity event on november 8 in nearby scottsdale where several of the players modeled the uniforms on a runway and posed for publicity photos the distinctive a design remained unchanged save for the colors the stylized snakelike d logo also used since the early days for the road uniforms was slightly redesigned and a completely new shoulder patch introduced the lettering on the jerseys was completely redesigned not only did the diamondbacks uniforms change but many faces of the organization changed as well  in addition to the trades detailed below in the 2007 regular season the diamondbacks enjoyed a relatively high degree of success with a young team including brandon webb conor jackson stephen drew carlos quentin chad tracy chris young miguel montero mark reynolds called up from doublea in may and justin upton called up from doublea in august the diamondbacks in the regular season posted the best record in the nl with 90 wins and 72 losses  despite their success they were actually outscored by a cumulative total of 20 runs in their games on september 28 the diamondbacks beat the colorado rockies to secure a position in the 2007 playoffs  after the padres defeat at the hands of the milwaukee brewers on september 29 the diamondbacks secured both the nl west title and home field throughout the nl playoffs after taking the first two games at home against the cubs in the national league division series they took the series to wrigley field where they completed their sweep earning their first berth in the national league championship series since 2001 in the nlcs where ironically they faced the rockies however the dbacks bats and any sort of luck they had fell silent  though the dbacks pitchers kept it close they just didnt seem to get any kind of situational hitting  plays in key situations uptons slide in game 1 stephen drews baserunning mistake and valverdes 3 walks in a row including a basesloaded walk in the 10th in game 2 yorvit torrealbas homer in game 3 conor jackson booting the ball in game 4 and even into the 8th and 9th innings of the final game with the dbacks trailing by two tony clark struck out leaving upton at third base in the 8th and in the 9th chris youngs leadoff double was wastedthe dbacks ran out of momentum against a colorado team who just couldnt lose and were swept by the rockies the 2007 season overall was a great success with many of the young players showing their potential and proving that the team would be a force in the national league for years to come on december 3 2007 the diamondbacks traded carlos quentin to the chicago white sox for first base prospect chris carter on december 14 in a blockbuster trade the diamondbacks acquired starting rhp dan haren from the oakland athletics for six players  lhp brett anderson lhp dana eveland and lhp greg smith the abovementioned justacquired infielder chris carter and outfielders aaron cunningham and carlos gonzalez the team also traded relief pitcher jose valverde who led the major leagues in saves in 2007 with 47 to the houston astros for reliever chad qualls rhp juan gutirrez and ifof chris burke valverde was expected to immediately become the astros closer haren was expected to immediately join the diamondbacks starting rotation which will include webb and hopefully randy johnson if he rehabilitates successfully from his seasonending back injuries johnson was acquired from the yankees in january 2007 and had a strong start to the 2007 season before back problems forced him out in august haren was 159 with a 307 era for oakland in 2007  this move was expected to make the dbacks favored to win the nl west in 2008 provided the offensive production is good arizona was not able to resign veteran free agents tony clark and livan hernandez who were picked up by san diego and minnesota respectively  after winning the opening game of the season on march 31 on the road against the cincinnati reds the diamondbacks found themselves with the best record in major league baseball 208 by the start of may  at

was due to become a free agent at the end of the season and speculation at the time was that he would not be resigned with the diamondbacks because he wanted a higher salary  on february 21 2009 hudson signed a oneyear deal with the los angeles dodgers reportedly worth 34million with an additional 46million more in performance bonuses lf eric byrnes was on the 60day disabled list from late

most of the season  dunn seemed quite positive about being traded to a ballclub in first place in its division in august the move was seen by some fansdateaugust 2008 as a belated attempt by the dbacks to counter the trade by their division rival the los angeles dodgers for boston red sox powerhitting of manny ramirez on july 31 and also to compensate for the injuries to hudson and byrnes

by omari the speaker  made a farewell suicide video  in it he reads i am writing this with my full conscience and i am writing this in expectation of the end which is near  god praise everybody who trained and helped me namely the leader sheikh osama bin laden according to fbi director robert mueller and the 911 commission omari entered the united states through a dubai flight on june 29 2001 with salem alhazmi landing in new york he had used the controversial visa express program to gain entry he apparently stayed with several other hijackers in paterson new jersey before moving to his own place at 4032 57th terrace vero beach florida on his rental agreement form for that house omari gave two licenseplates authorized to park in his space one of which was registered to atta omari occasionally trained on simulators at the flightsafety academy in vero beach florida together with mohand alshehri and saeed alghamdi omari obtained a fake united states id card from all services plus in passaic county new jersey which was in the business of selling fake documents including another to khalid almihdhar on september 10 2001 mohamed atta picked up omari from the milner hotel in boston massachusetts and the two drove their rented nissan to a comfort inn in south portland maine where they spent the night in room 232   it was initially reported that adnan and ameer bukhari were the two hijackers who had rented and driven the car in the early hours of september 11 they boarded a commuter flight back to boston to connect to american airlines flight 11  american 11 was hijacked 15 minutes after the flight departed by omari and four other hijackers which allowed trained pilot mohamed atta to crash the boeing 767 into the north tower of the world trade center as part of an attack that killed thousands of people controversy over omaris identity erupted shortly after the attacks  at first the fbi had named abdul rahman alomari a pilot for saudi arabian airlines as the pilot of flight 11  it was quickly shown that this person was still alive and the fbi issued an apology it was also  quickly determined that mohamed atta was the pilot among the hijackers the fbi then named abdulaziz alomari as a hijacker a man with the same name as those given by the fbi turned up alive in saudi arabia saying that he had studied at the university of denver and his passport was stolen there in 1995  the name origin birth date and occupation were released by the fbi but the picture was not of him i couldnt believe it when the fbi put me on their list he said they gave my name and my date of birth but i am not a suicide bomber i am here i am alive i have no idea how to fly a plane i had nothing to do with this  this individual was not the same person as the hijacker whose identity was later confirmed by saudi government interviews with his family according to the 911 commission report', 'assaultgun an assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armored chassis designed for use in the direct fire role in support of infantry when attacking other infantry or fortified positions historically the custombuilt fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis the use of a casemate instead of a gun turret limited these weapons field of fire but provided a simpler construction that was cheaper to build and less prone to mechanical breakdowns the increased space and reduced weight of the turretless design also allowed for the mounting of a larger weapon and heavier frontal armour on any given chassis   in most cases these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy assault guns were primarily used during world war ii by the forces of nazi germany and the soviet union early in the war the germans began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their infantry support weapons on the bed of a truck or on obsolete tanks with the turret removed  later in the war both the germans and the soviets introduced fully armored purposebuilt assault guns into their arsenals early on the soviets built the kv2 a variant of the kv1 heavy tank with a shortbarreled 152 mm howitzer mounted in an oversized turret  this was not a success in battle and was replaced with a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns the su76 su122 and the heavy su152 which were followed by the isu122 and isu152 on the new is heavy tank chassis the primary german assault gun was the sturmgeschtz iii stug iii armed with a highvelocity dualpurpose 75mm gun late production stug iii variants blurred the line between assault guns and tank destroyers the germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns including the stug iv stuh 42 brummbr and sturmtiger the latter two were very heavy vehicles and were built only in small quantities battalions of assault guns usually stug iiis commonly replaced the intended panzer battalion in the german panzergrenadier divisions due to the chronic shortage of tanks and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the panzer divisions  independent battalions were also deployed as stiffeners for infantry divisions and the stug iiis antitank capabilities contributed greatly to the germans ability to draw out world war two after they had lost the strategic initiative  however command problems ensued as the assault guns were considered to be artillery by the wehrmacht despite that they were and should be employed as a tank therefore the assault guns were not under the control of the panzer units commanding officer reducing unit effectiveness british and american forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer  among these was the m4105 a m4 sherman tank armed with a 105 mm howitzer  in addition the mark iv version of the centaur tank and the mark v and the mark viii versions of the churchill tank were fitted with 95mm howitzers  as the amount of german armour encountered by the allies decreased especially in italy a number of american tank destroyer units were used in the assault gun role for infantry support the avre version of the churchill tank was armed with a spigot mortar that fired a forty pound 18kg hefilled projectile nicknamed the flying dustbin 150 yards 137 metres  its task was to attack fortified positions such as bunkers at close range see hobarts funnies in the postwwii era vehicles fitting into an assault gun category were developed as a lightweight airdeployable direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops  current weapons were either based on jeeps or small tracked vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons the soviet union and the united states were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces   their answers to the problem were similar with the united states developing the m56 scorpion and the soviet union developing the asu57 both essentially airdroppable light antitank guns the soviets went on to develop an improved airdroppable assault gun the asu85 which served through the 1980s while their su100 remained in service with communist countries including vietnam and cuba years after ww2 the us m56 and another similar vehicle the m50 ontos were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in us service   improvised arrangements such as m113 personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the antitank role the only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the m50 and m56 from service within the us military was the m551 sheridan the sheridans gun was a lowvelocity weapon suitable in the assault role but with the addition of the shillelagh missile could double in the antitank role as well it is important however to remember that the sheridan was not developed as an assault gun but as a light reconnaissance vehicle currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a tank destroyer or assault gun role with the us testing the m1128 stryker mgs the centauro wheeled tank destroyer of the italian army and the french amx 10 rc heavy armored car are also good examples   while these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role none were developed with this specifically in mind reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the us military in the assault gun role during wwii', 'asroma roma have won serie a three times first in 194142 then in 198283 and again in 200001 as well as winning nine coppa italia titles and two supercoppa italiana titles  on the european stage roma won an intercities fairs cup in 196061 coming close to european cup glory in 198384 lost the onelegged final played at home against liverpool after a penalty shootout and  finishing as runnersup in the uefa cup for 199091 twolegged aggregate defeat against internazionale home games are currently played at the stadio olimpico a venue they share with city rivals lazio with a capacity of over 72000 it is the second largest of its kind in italy with only san siro able to seat more  in september 2009 the club unveiled plans to build a new 55000capacity stadium in the western suburbs of rome its design will be modeled after english football stadiums with the objective being to give fans a closer view of the pitch as roma was founded in the summer of 1927 by italo foschi the only major roman club to resist the merger was ss lazio because of the intervention of the fascist militia general vaccaro member of the club and executive of italian football federation the club played its earliest seasons at the motovelodromo appio stadium before settling in the workingclass streets of testaccio where it built an allwooden ground campo testaccio this was opened in november 1929 after a slump in league form and the departure of high key players roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the argentine enrique guaita under the management of luigi barbesino the roman club came close to their first title in 193536 finishing just one point behind champions bologna roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the 194142 season by winning their first ever scudetto title the eighteen goals scored by local player amedeo amadei were essential to the alfrd schaffer coached roma side winning the title  at the time italy was involved in world war ii and roma were playing at the stadio del partito nazionale fascista in the years just after the war roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s   roma finished in the lower half of serie a for five seasons in a row before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to serie b at the end of the 195051 season around a decade after their championship victory  under future national team manager giuseppe viani promotion straight back up was achieved after returning to the serie a roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as egisto pandolfini dino da costa and dane helge brone although roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade they did achieve some measure of cup success  their first honour outside of italy was recorded in 196061 when roma won the intercities fairs cup by beating birmingham city 42 in the finals a few years later roma won their first coppa italia trophy in 196364 by beating torino 10 their lowest point came during the 196465 season when manager juan carlos lorenzo announced that the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to vicenza to fulfil its next fixture  supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the sistine theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president franco evangelisti their second coppa italia trophy was won in 196869 when it was competed in a small league like system roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972 with a 31 victory over blackpool in the angloitalian cup during much of the 1970s romas appearance in the top half of serie a was sporadic the best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in 197475 the dawning of a newly successful era in romas footballing history was brought in with another coppa italia victory they beat torino on penalties to win the 197980 cup  former milan player nils liedholm was the manager at the time with prominent players such as bruno conti agostino di bartolomei roberto pruzzo and falco the second scudetto did not elude roma for much longer in 198283 the roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years amidst joyous celebrations in the capital the following season roma finished as runnersup in italy romas successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runnersup spot in 198586 after that a comparative decline began in the league one of the few league highs from the following period was a third place finish in 198788 the same season the club won its seventh coppa italia trophy the club attempted to defend the title in the following season but ended as runnersup to juventus by just one point a serie a scandal was revealed during 2006 and roma were one of the teams not involved after punishments were handed out roma was reclassified as runnersup for 200506 the same season in which they finished second in the coppa italia losing to internazionale meanwhile in the uefa champions league during both of these seasons they reached the quarterfinals before going out to manchester united despite the sloppy start in uefa champions league 200809 roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of chelsea in their group thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage  however the giallorossi would lose to arsenal in the knockout stage on penalty kicks ending their champions league campaign after a disappointing start to the 200910 season claudio ranieri replaced luciano spalletti as head coach   at the time of the switch roma lay bottom of the serie a table after losses to juventus and genoa despite this setback roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league  with the last of the 24 being a 21 win over rivals lazio whereby roma came from 10 down at halftime to defeat their city rivals after ranieri courageously substituted both totti and de rossi at the interval the giallorossi were on top of the table at one point before a loss to uc sampdoria later in the season  roma would finish runnersup to inter yet again in both serie a and the coppa italia this rounded out a highly successful decade in romas history following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s  during the 2000s roma had finally recaptured the scudetto two coppa italia trophies and their first two supercoppa italiana titles  other notable contributions to the clubs history have included a return to the uefa champions league quarterfinals in the 20062007 and 20072008 editions since 1984 six runners up positions in the league four coppa italia finals and three supercoppa finals  marking romas greatest ever decade roma have had numerous presidents over the course of their history some of which have been the owners of the club others have been honorary presidents  franco sensi was the chairman until his death in 2008 with his daughter rosella sensi in place as honorary president roma have had many managers and trainers running the team during their

same colours the gold symbolizes god in roman catholicism while the maroon represents imperial dignity  white shorts and black socks are usually worn with the maroon red shirt however in particularly high key games the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt the kit itself was originally worn by roman football club one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927  because of the colours they wear roma are often nicknamed i giallorossi meaning the yellowreds  romas away kit is traditionally white with a third kit changing colour from time to time maybe because of modern sport marketing the last few years have seen the golden trim and details substituted by light orange  modern alternate kits have included all orange and orangemaroon versions a popular nickname for the club is i lupi the wolves the animal has always featured on the clubs badge in different forms throughout their history  currently the emblem of the team is the one which was

nickname and logo the twins sons of mars and rhea silvia are thrown into the river tiber by their uncle amulius a shewolf saved the twins and looked after them roma is the fifth most supported football club in italy behind juventus internazionale milan and napoli with around 6 of italian football fans supporting the club according to the doxa institutelespressos research of april 2006  historically the largest section of roma supporters in the city of rome have come from the innercity  especially testaccio the traditional ultras group of the club was commando ultr curva sud the most known club anthem and motto is romaromaroma by local singer antonello venditti the title roughly means roma is not to be questioned it is to be loved and is sung before each match the song grazie roma

are a club with many rivalries first and foremost is their rivalry with lazio the club who they share the stadio olimpico stadium with the derby between the two is called the derby della capitale it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world the fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past including the death of lazio fan vincenzo paparelli in 197980 as a result of an emergency flare fired from the curva sud and the abandonment of a game in march 2004 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium with napoli roma also compete in the derby del sole rivalry meaning the derby of the sun there have been a number of instances of conflict in recent years between some roma supporters and fans of english clubs pointing to an apparent dislike for english fans in some giallorossi supporters  one reason forwarded for this is the defeat to liverpool in the 1984 european cup final at the stadio olimpico since then there have been further instances of some english supporters being attacked and stabbed in rome including incidents in 2001 when liverpool visited roma twice and subsequent clashes with middlesbrough fans in 2006 and manchester united fans in 2007  in march 2009 a coach carrying arsenal supporters was attacked by a group of roma ultras just outside the stadio olimpico the coachs windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle letting off a flare and stabbed a supporter in the knee since 1999 during franco sensis period in charge associazione sportiva roma has

literature of the baroque period and in french poetry of the early modern and modern periods  drama in english often used alexandrines before marlowe and shakespeare by whom it was supplanted by iambic pentameter 5foot verse  in nonanglosaxon or french contexts the term dodecasyllable is often used in syllabic verse such as that used in french literature an alexandrine is a line of twelve syllables   most commonly the line is divided into two equal parts by a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables  alternatively the line is divided into three foursyllable sections by two caesuras the dramatic works of pierre corneille and jean racine are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets the caesura after the 6th syllable is here marked  baudelaires les bijoux the jewels is a typical example of the use of the alexandrine in 19thcentury french poetry  even a 20thcentury surrealist such as paul luard used alexandrines on occasion such as in these lines from lgalit des sexes in capitale de la douleur note the variation between caesuras after the 6th syllable and after 4th and 8th in the comic book asterix and cleopatra the author goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines when the druid panoramix getafix in the english translation  meets his alexandrian egyptian friend the latter exclaims je suis mon cher ami  trs heureux de te voir at which panoramix observes cest un alexandrin thats an alexandrinehes an alexandrian the pun can also be heard in the theatrical adaptations the english translation renders this as my dear old getafix  how good to see you here with the reply aha an alexandrine in accentualsyllabic verse it is a line of iambic hexameter  a line of six feet or measures iambs each of which has two syllables with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable it is also usual for there to be a caesura between the sixth and seventh syllables as the examples from pope below illustrate   robert bridges noted that in the lyrical sections of samson agonistes milton significantly varied the placement of the caesura in the poetry of edmund spensers the faerie queene 8 lines of pentameter are followed by an alexandrine the 6foot line slowing the regular rhythm of the 5foot lines   after spenser alexandrine couplets were used by michael drayton in his polyolbion alexander pope famously characterized the alexandrines potential to slow or speed the flow of a poem in two rhyming couplets consisting of an iambic pentameter followed by an alexandrine a few lines later pope continues alexandrines are sometimes introduced into predominantly pentameter verse for the sake of variety the spenserian stanza for instance is eight lines of pentameter followed by an alexandrine   alexandrines appear rarely in shakespeares blank verse  in the restoration and eighteenth century poetry written in couplets is sometimes varied by the introduction of a triplet in which the third line is an alexandrine as in this example from dryden which introduces a triplet after two couplets alexandrines also formed the first line of the couplet form poulters measure the second line being a fourteener as exemplified in henry howard earl of surreys poem complaint of the absence of her lover being upon the sea 1547 there is some doubt as to the origin of the name but most probably it is derived from a collection of alexandrine romances collected in the 12th century of which alexander the great was the hero and in which he was represented somewhat like the british arthur as the pride and crown of chivalry  before the publication of this work most of the trouvre romances appeared in octosyllabic verse there is also a theory that the form was invented by the 12thcentury poet alexander of paris the new work which was henceforth to set the fashion to french literature was written in lines of twelve syllables but with a freedom of pause which was afterwards greatly curtailed the new fashion however was not adopted all at once the metre fell into disuse until the reign of francis i when it was revived by jeanantoine de baf one of the seven poets known as la pliade', 'artillery originally applied to any group of infantry primarily armed with projectile weapons artillery has over time become limited in meaning to refer only to those engines of war that operate by projection of munitions far beyond the range of effect of personal weapons   these engines comprise specialised devices which use some form of stored energy to operate whether mechanical chemical or electromagnetic   originally designed to breach fortifications they have evolved from nearly static installations intended to reduce a single obstacle to highly mobile weapons of great flexibility in which now reposes the greater portion of a modern armys offensive capabilities in common speech the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices together with their accessories and fittings although these assemblages are more properly referred to as equipments  by association artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines artillery may also refer to a system of applied scientific research relating to the design manufacture and employment of artillery weapon systems although in general the terms ballistics and ordnance are more commonly employed in this sense although not called as such machines recognizable as artillery have been employed in warfare since antiquity the first references in the western historical tradition may be those of hero of alexandria c  ad 1c but these devices were widely employed by the roman legions in republican times well before the christian era   through much of their early history artillery was treated as part of the engineering art because the devices were often constructed mostly of local materials whenever needed and not permanently assembled   until the introduction of gunpowder into western warfare artillery depended upon mechanical energy to operate and this severely limited the range and size of projectiles while also requiring the construction of very large apparatus to store sufficient energy for much of artillerys history during the middle ages and the early modern period artillery pieces on land were moved with the assistance of horse teams  during the more recent modern era and in the postmodern period the artillery crew has used wheeled or tracked vehicles as a mode of transportation  artillery used by naval forces has changed significantly also with missiles replacing guns in surface warfare over the course of military history projectiles were manufactured from a wide variety of materials made in a wide variety of shapes and used different means of inflicting physical damage and casualties to defeat specific types of targets the engineering designs of the means of delivery have likewise changed significantly over time and have become some of the most complex technological application today in some armies the weapon of artillery is the projectile not the piece that fires it the process of delivering fire onto the target is called gunnery the actions involved in operating the piece are collectively called serving the gun or detachment by the gun crew constituting either direct or indirect artillery fire the manner in which artillery units or formations are employed is called artillery support and may at different periods in history refer to weapons designed to be fired from ground sea and even airbased weapons platforms although the term also describes soldiers and sailors with the primary function of using artillery weapons the individuals who operate them are called gunners irrespective of their rank however gunner is the lowest rank in artillery arms  there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun howitzer mortar and so forth some armies use artillery piece while others use gun the projectiles fired by artillery are typically either shot if solid or shell if not  shell is a widely used generic term for a projectile which is a component of munitions the term artillery is also applied to a combat arm of most military services when used organizationally to describe units and formations of the national armed forces that operate the weapons the gunners and their guns are usually grouped in teams called either crews or detachments  several such crews and teams with other functions are combined into a unit of artillery usually called a battery although sometimes called a company  batteries are roughly equivalent to a company in the infantry and are combined into larger military organizations for administrative and operational purpose during military operations the role of field artillery is to provide close support to other arms in combat or to attack targets the latter role is typically achieved by delivering either high explosive munitions to inflict casualties on the enemy from casing fragments and other debris and blast or by demolition of enemy positions equipment and vehicles the artillery fire may be directed by an artillery observer military doctrine has played a significant influence on the core engineering design considerations of artillery ordnance through its history in seeking to achieve a balance between delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility  however during the modern period the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late19th century introduction of the new generation of infantry weapons using conoidal bullet better known as the mini ball with a range almost as long as that of field artillery the gunners increasing proximity to and participation in direct combat against other combat arms and attacks by aircraft made the introduction of a gun shield necessary the problems of how to employ a fixed or horse towed gun in mobile warfare necessitated the development of new methods of transporting the artillery into combat   three distinct forms of artillery developed the tank which later became a combat arm in its own right as the technology matured beyond a simple tracked box with a cannon mounted in it the selfpropelled gun which was designed to accompany a mobile force and provide continuous fire support and the towed gun which was used primarily to attack or defend a fixed line   these influences have guided the development of artillery ordnance systems organisations and operations until the present with artillery systems capable of providing support at ranges from as little as 100m to the intercontinental ranges of ballistic missiles the only combat in which artillery is unable to take part in is close quarters combat the word as used in the current context originated in the middle ages one suggestion is that it comes from the old french atellier meaning to arrange and attillement meaning equipment from the 13th century an artillier referred to a builder of any war equipment and for the next 250 years the sense of the word artillery covered all forms of military weapons  hence the naming of the honourable artillery company an essentially infantry unit until the 19th century  another suggestion is that comes from the italian arte de tirare art of shooting coined by one of the first theorists on the use of artillery niccolo tartaglia mechanical systems used for throwing ammunition in ancient warfare also known as engines of war like the catapult onager trebuchet and the ballista are also referred to by military historians as artillery the first documented record of artillery with gunpowder propellant used on the battlefield was on january 28 1132 when general han shizhong of the song dynasty used escalade and huochong to capture a city in fujian these small crude weapons diffused into the middle east the madfaa and reached europe in the 13th century in a very limited manner in asia mongols adopted the chinese artillery and used it effectively in the great conquest  by late 14th ad chinese rebels used organized artillery and cavalry to push mongols out the new ming dynasty established the divine engine battalion   specialized in various types of artillery  light cannons and cannons with multiple volleys were developed  in a campaign to suppress a local minority rebellion near todays burmese border the ming army used a 3line method of arquebusesmuskets to destroy an elephant formation  between 1593 and 1597 about 300000 chinese and japanese troops fought in korea and both sides used heavy artillery in land and sea battles in 1415 the portuguese invaded the mediterranean port town of ceuta while it is difficult to confirm the use of firearms in the siege of the city it is known that the portuguese defended it thereafter with firearms namely bombardas colebratas and falconetes   in 1419 sultan abu said led an army to reconquer the fallen city and moroccans brought cannons and used them in the assault on ceuta finally handheld firearms and riflemen appear in morocco in 1437 in an expedition against the people of tangiers it is clear that these weapons had developed into several different forms from small guns to large artillery units the artillery revolution in europe caught on during the hundred years war and changed the way that battles were fought  in the following year the english used a gunpowder weapon in a military campaign against the scottish however at this time the cannons used in battle were very small and not particularly powerful   cannons were only useful for the defense of a castle as demonstrated in the battle of breteuil in 1356 when the besieged english used a cannon to destroy an attacking french assault tower   by the end of the 14th century cannons were only powerful enough to knock in roofs and therefore could not penetrate castle walls however a major change occurred between 14201430 when artillery became much more powerful and could now batter strongholds and fortresses quite efficiently   both the english french and burgundians advanced in military technology and as a result the traditional advantage that went to the defense in a siege was lost the cannons during this period were elongated and the recipe for gunpowder was improved to make it three times as powerful as before   these changes led to the increased power in the artillery weapons of the time joan of arc encountered gunpowder weaponry several times   when she led the french against the english at the battle of tourelles in 1430 she faced heavy gunpowder fortifications and yet her troops prevailed in that battle   in addition she led assaults against the englishheld towns of jargeau meung and beaugency all with the support of large artillery units   when she led the assault on paris joan faced stiff artillery fire especially from the suburb of st denis which ultimately led to her defeat in this battle   in april 1430 she went to battle against the burgundians whose support was purchased by the english at this time the burgundians had the strongest and largest gunpowder arsenal among the european powers and yet the french under joan of arcs leadership were able to beat back the burgundians and defend themselves   as a result most of the battles of the hundred years war that joan of arc participated in were fought with gunpowder artillery as small smoothbore tubes these were initially cast in iron or bronze around a core with the first drilled bore ordnance recorded in operation near seville in 1247  they fired lead iron or stone balls sometimes large arrows and on occasions simply handfuls of whatever scrap came to hand  during the hundred years war 13371453 these weapons became more common initially as the bombard and later the cannon  cannon were always loaded from the muzzles  while there were many early attempts at breechloading designs a lack of engineering knowledge rendered these even more dangerous to use than muzzleloaders bombards were of value mainly in sieges a famous turkish example used at the siege of constantinople in 1453 weighed 19 tons took 200 men and sixty oxen to emplace and could fire seven times a day the fall of constantinople was perhaps the first event of supreme importance whose result was determined by the use of artillery when the huge bronze cannons of mehmed ii made by the hungarian orban breached the walls of constantinople thereby ending the byzantine empire according to sir charles oman bombards developed in europe were massive smoothbore weapons distinguished by their lack of a field carriage immobility once emplaced highly individual design and noted unreliability in 1460 james ii king of scots was killed when one exploded at the siege of roxburgh their large size precluded the barrels being cast and they were constructed out of metal staves or rods bound together with hoops like a barrel giving their name to the gun barrel the use of the word cannon marks the introduction in the 15th century of a dedicated field carriage with axle trail and animaldrawn limberthis produced mobile field pieces that could move and support an army in action rather than being found only in siege and static defences the reduction in the size of the barrel was due to improvements in both iron technology and gunpowder manufacture while the development of the trunnion  projections at the side of the cannon as an integral part of the cast  allowed the barrel to be fixed to a more movable base and also made raising or lowering the barrel much easier the first landbased mobile weapon is usually credited to jan ika who deployed his oxenhauled cannon during the hussite wars of bohemia 14181424  however cannons were still large and cumbersome  with the rise of musketry in the 16th century cannon were largely though not entirely displaced from the battlefieldthe cannon were too slow and cumbersome to be used and too easily lost to a rapid enemy advance the combining of shot and powder into a single unit a cartridge occurred in the 1620s with a simple fabric bag and was quickly adopted by all nations it speeded loading and made it safer but unexpelled bag fragments were an additional fouling in the gun barrel and a new toola wormwas introduced to remove them  gustavus adolphus is identified as the general who made cannon an effective force on the battlefieldpushing the development of much lighter and smaller weapons and deploying them in far greater numbers than previously but the outcome of battles was still determined by the clash of infantry shells explosivefilled fused projectiles were also developed in the 17th century the development of specialized piecesshipboard artillery howitzers and mortarswas also begun in this period  more esoteric designs like the multibarrel ribauldequin were also built the 1650 book by kazimierz siemienowicz artis magnae artilleriae pars prima  was one of the most important contemporary publications on the subject of artillery  for over two centuries this work was used in europe as a basic artillery manual one of the most significant effects of artillery during this period was however somewhat more indirect  by easily reducing to rubble any medievaltype fortification or city wall some which had stood since roman times it abolished millennia of siegewarfare strategies and styles of fortification building cannons continued to become smaller and lighterfrederick ii of prussia deployed the first genuine light artillery during the seven years warbut until the mid19th century improvements in metallurgy chemistry manufacturing and other sciences did not alter the basic design and operation of a cannon another major change at this time was the development of a flintlock firing mechanism for the cannons the old method of firing the cannon involved the use of a linstock or match to light a small quantity of powder charge in a touchhole drilled into the breech  this technique was quite faulty because the ignited powder could easily be extinguished by rain and an excess amount of charge could cause the guns to burst the flintlock mechanism on the other hand only needs to be cocked and when its trigger is pulled the flint of the hammer strikes the frizzen throwing sparks into the pan and detonating the charge at the breech the trigger can be tied to a lanyard and fired from a safe distance  these changes laid down in 1789 would prove decisive for napoleons conquests  napoleon himself a former artillery officer perfected the tactic of massed artillery batteries unleashed upon a critical point in his enemies line as prelude to infantry and cavalry assault and more often than not victory rifling had been tried on small arms in the 15th century the machinery to accurately rifle a cannon barrel did not arrive until the 19th century  cavelli wahrendorff and whitworth all independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s but these guns did not see widespread use until the latter stages of the american civil warwhen designs such as the various caliber rodman guns came to prominence from the 1860s artillery was forced into a series of rapid technological and operational changes accelerating through the 1870s and thereafter the first effective breechloader allowing a higher rate of fire while keeping the detachment behind the gun was developed in 1855 by sir william armstrong and accepted for british service in 1859  the first cannon to contain all modern features is generally considered to be the french 75 of 1897 with its cased ammunition effective breechloading modern sights selfcontained firing mechanism and hydropneumatic recoil dampening after the war of 1870 the germans became strong advocates of indirect fire  in 1882 a russian officer lieutenant colonel kg guk published a book indirect fire for field artillery that provided a practical method of using aiming points for indirect fire by describing all the essentials of aiming points crest clearance and corrections to fire by an observer the movement toward precision fires did not begin until late in world war i in 1916 the russians conducted their first registration point shoot the adjustment of fire onto one target to identify inaccuracy then switching to another while applying the known correction to achieve accuracy and surprise  artillery had begun the shift away from massed fires to a greater emphasis on precision fires modern artillery is most obviously distinguished by its large caliber firing an explosive shell or rocket and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized carriage for firing and transport  however its most important characteristic is the use of indirect fire whereby the firing equipment is aimed without seeing the target through its sights  indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of predicted fire methods in world war i indirect fire uses firing data set on the sights predicted fire methods ensure that these data are accurate and corrects for variations from the standard conditions for muzzle velocity temperature wind and air density weapons covered by the term modern artillery include cannon artillery such as the howitzer mortar and field gun and rocket artillery  certain smallercaliber mortars are more properly designated small arms rather than artillery albeit indirectfire small arms  this term also came to include coastal artillery which traditionally defended coastal areas against seaborne attack and controlled the passage of ships  with the advent of powered flight at the start of the 20th century artillery also included groundbased antiaircraft batteries the term artillery has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal guidance systems even though some artillery units employ surfacetosurface missiles  advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed largecaliber projectiles to be developed blurring this distinction one of the most important role of logistics is the supply of munitions as a primary type of artillery consumable their storage and the provision of fuses detonators and warheads at the point where artillery troops will assemble the charge projectile bomb or shell a round of artillery ammunition comprises four components the normal artillery spelling is fuze  fuzes are the devices that trigger explosion of the artillery ammunition charge  broadly there are four main types most artillery fuzes are nose fuzes  however base fuzes have been used with armour piercing shells and for squash head hesh or hep antitank shells  at least one nuclear shell and its nonnuclear spotting version also used a multideck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base impact fuzes were and in some armies remain the standard fuze for he their default action is normally superquick some have had a graze action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have delay  delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding concrete piercing fuzes are an extreme case of this and specially hardened  during world war i and later ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed he shells fired with a flat angle of descent was used to achieve airburst he shells can be fitted with other fuzes airburst fuzes usually have a combined airburst and impact function  however until the introduction of proximity fuzes the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitionsfor example shrapnel illumination and smoke the larger calibers of antiaircraft artillery are almost always used airburst  airburst fuzes have to have the fuze length running time set on them  this is done just before firing using either a wrench or a fuze setter preset to the required fuze length early airburst fuzes used igniferous timers which lasted into the second half of the 20th century  mechanical time fuzes appeared in the early part of that century  these required a means of powering them the thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement ie clockwork junghans used centrifugal force and gears and dixi used centrifugal force and balls  from about 1980 electronic time fuzes started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions proximity fuzes have been of two types photoelectric or radar the former was not very successful and seems only to have been used with british antiaircraft artillery unrotated projectiles ie rockets in world war ii radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical nonproximity fuzes which they replaced   mechanical time fuzes required an accurate calculation of their running time which was affected by nonstandard conditions  with he requiring a burst 20 to 30 feet above the ground if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high  accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher the first radar proximity fuzes called vt for variable time as an obfuscating security measure were initially used against aircraft in world war ii their ground use was delayed for fear of the enemy recovering blinds artillery shells which failed to detonate and copying the fuze the first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about convert30 above the ground  these airbursts are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver a greater proportion of useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts however proximity fuzes can suffer premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds  this led to controlled variable time cvt after world war ii these fuzes have a mechanical timer that switched on the radar about 5 seconds before expected impact they also detonated on impact the proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of europe in late december 1944  they have become known as the us artillerys christmas present and were much appreciated when they arrived during the battle of the bulge they were also used to great effect in antiaircraft projectiles in the pacific against kamikaze planes as well as in britain against v1 flying bombs electronic multifunction fuzes started to appear around 1980   using solidstate electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable and became the standard fitted fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies the early versions were often limited to proximity airburst albeit with height of burst options and impact some offered a gonogo functional test through the fuze setter later versions introduced induction fuze setting and testing instead of physically placing a fuze setter on the fuze the latest such as junghans dm84u provide options giving superquick delay a choice of proximity heights of burst time and a choice of foliage penetration depths a new type of artillery fuze will appear soon   in addition to other functions these offer some course correction capability not full precision but sufficient to significantly reduce the dispersion of the shells on the ground the projectile is the munition or bullet fired downrange  this may or may not be an explosive device  traditionally projectiles have been classified as shot or shell the former being solid and the latter having some form of payload shells can also be divided into three configurations bursting base ejection or nose ejection the latter is sometimes called the shrapnel configuration the most modern is base ejection which was introduced in world war i both base and nose ejection are almost always used with airburst fuzes  bursting shells use various types of fuze depending on the nature of the payload and the tactical need at the time payloads have included aeronautic federation and modern exotics such as electronic payloads and sensorfuzed munitions finstabilized artillery shellpublisherpatentstorm guidance or gliding guided artillery missile with extremely long rangepublisherpatentstorm all forms of artillery require a propellant to propel the projectile at the target  propellant is always a low explosive this means it deflagrates instead of detonating as with high explosives the shell is accelerated to a high velocity in a very short time by the rapid generation of gas from the burning propellant  this high pressure is achieved by burning the propellant in a contained area either the chamber of a gun barrel or the combustion chamber of a rocket motor until the late 19th century the only available propellant was black powder  black powder had many disadvantages as a propellant it has relatively low power requiring large amounts of powder to fire projectiles and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets betray the positions of guns and make aiming impossible  in 1846 nitrocellulose also known as guncotton was discovered and the high explosive nitroglycerin was discovered at much the same time   nitrocellulose was significantly more powerful than black powder and was smokeless   early guncotton was unstable however and burned very fast and hot leading to greatly increased barrel wear  widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until the advent of the doublebase powders which combine nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin to produce powerful smokeless stable propellant many other formulations were developed in the following decades generally trying to find the optimum characteristics of a good artillery propellant low temperature high energy non corrosive highly stable cheap and easy to manufacture in large quantities  broadly modern gun propellants are divided into three classes singlebase propellants which are mainly or entirely nitrocellulose based doublebase propellants composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and triple base composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and nitroguanidine artillery shells fired from a barrel can be assisted to greater range in three ways propelling charges for tube artillery can be provided in one of two ways either as cartridge bags or in metal cartridge cases  generally antiaircraft artillery and smaller caliber up to 6 or 1524mm guns use metal cartridge cases that include the round and propellant similar to a modern rifle cartridge  this simplifies loading and is necessary for very high rates of fire  bagged propellant allows the amount of powder to be raised or lowered depending on the range to the target it also makes handling of larger shells easier  each requires a totally different type of breech to the other a metal case holds an integral primer to initiate the propellant and provides the gas seal to prevent the gases leaking out of the breech this is called obturation  with bagged charges the breech itself provides obturation and holds the primer  in either case the primer is usually percussion but electrical is also used and laser ignition is emerging  modern 155mm guns have a primer magazine fitted to their breech artillery ammunition has four classifications according to use because field artillery mostly uses indirect fire the guns have to be part of a system that enables them to attack targets invisible to them in accordance with the combined arms plan the main functions in the field artillery system are organisationally and spatially these functions can be arranged in many ways  since the creation of modern indirect fire different armies have done it differently at different times and in different places  technology is often a factor but so are militarysocial issues the relationships between artillery and other arms and the criteria by which military capability efficiency and effectiveness are judged  cost is also an issue because artillery is expensive due to the large quantities of ammunition that it uses and its level of manpower the emergence of mobile and manportable radios after world war i had a major impact on artillery because it enable fast and mobile operations with observers accompanying the infantry or armoured troops  in world war ii some armies fitted their selfpropelled guns with radios  however sometimes in the first half of the 20th century hardcopy artillery fire plans and map traces were distributed data communications can be especially important for artillery because by using structured messages and defined data types fire control messages can be automatically routed and processed by computers  for example a target acquisition element can send a message with target details which is automatically routed through the tactical and technical fire control elements to deliver firing data to the guns laying system and the gun automatically laid  as tactical data networks become pervasive they will provide any connected soldier with a means for reporting target information and requesting artillery fire observation equipment can vary widely in its complexity broadly there are two situations fire against opportunity targets and targets whose engagement is planned as part of a particular operation  in the latter situation command assigns fire units to the operation and an overall artillery fire planner makes a plan possibly delegating resources for some parts of it to other planners  fire plans may also involve use of nonartillery assets such as mortars and aircraft control of fire against opportunity targets is an important differentiator between different types of artillery system  in some armies only designated artillery hqs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target all calls for fire being requests to these hqs this authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used  in other armies an authorised observer eg artillery observation team or other target acquisition element can order fire units to engage  in the latter case a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion and sometimes to many battalions  for example a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery  when observers or cells are not authorised they can still request fire armies that apply forward tactical control generally put the majority of the more senior officers of artillery units forward in command observation posts or with the supported arm  those that do not use this approach tend to put these officers close to the guns  in either case the observation element usually controls fire in detail against the target such as adjusting it onto the target moving it and coordinating it with the supported arm as necessary to achieve the required effects however the need to engage targets at night in depth or hit the target with the first rounds quickly led to predicted fire being developed in world war i predicted fire existed alongside the older method  after world war ii predicted methods were invariably applied but the fall of shot usually needed adjustment because of inaccuracy in locating the target the proximity of friendly troops or the need to engage a moving target  target location errors were significantly reduced once laser rangefinders orientation and navigation devices were issued to observation parties in predicted fire the basic geospatial data of range angle of sight and azimuth between a fire unit and its target was produced and corrected for variations from the standard conditions  these variations included barrel wear propellant temperature different projectiles weights that all affected the muzzle velocity and air temperature density wind speed  direction and rotation of the earth that affect the shell in flight the net effect of variations can also be determined by shooting at an accurately known point a process called registration all these calculations to produce a quadrant elevation or range and azimuth were done manually by highly trained soldiers using instruments tabulated data data of the moment and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the 1960s and 70s  while some early calculators copied the manual method typically substituting polynomials for tabulated data computers use a different approach they simulate a shells trajectory by flying it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step  this simulation is repeated until it produces a quadrant elevation and azimuth that lands the shell within the required closing distance of the target coordinates  nato has a standard ballistic model for computer calculations and has expanded the scope of this into the nato armaments ballistic kernel nabk technical fire control has been performed in various places but mostly in firing batteries  however in the 1930s the french moved it to battalion level and combined it with some tactical fire control   this was copied by the us nevertheless most armies seemed to have retained it within firing batteries and some duplicated the technical fire control teams in a battery to give operational resilience and tactical flexibility  computers reduced the number of men needed and enabled decentralisation of technical fire control to autonomous subbattery fire units such as platoons troops or sections although some armies had sometimes done this with their manual methods  computation on the gun or launcher integrated with their laying system is also possible  mlrs led the way in this a fire unit is the smallest artillery or mortar element consisting of one or more weapon systems capable of being employed to execute a fire assigned by a tactical fire controller  generally it is a battery but subdivided batteries are quite common and in some armies very common  on occasions a battery of 6 guns has been 6 fire units  fire units may or may not occupy separate positions  geographically dispersed fire units may or may not have an integral capability for technical fire control artillery has always been equipment intensive and for centuries artillery provided its own artificers to maintain and repair their equipment  most armies now place these services in specialist branches with specialist repair elements in batteries and units artillery types can be categorised in several ways for example by type or size of weapon or ordnance by role or by organizational arrangements the types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles types of artillery modern field artillery can also be split into two other categories towed and selfpropelled  as the name suggests towed artillery has a prime mover usually a jeep or truck to move the piece crew and ammunition around  selfpropelled howitzers are permanently mounted on a carriage or vehicle with room for the crew and ammunition and are thus capable of moving quickly from one firing position to another both to support the fluid nature of modern combat and to avoid counterbattery fire  there are also mortar carrier vehicles many of which allow the mortar to be removed from the vehicle and be used dismounted potentially in terrain in which the vehicle cannot navigate or in order to avoid detection at the beginning of the modern artillery period the late 19th century many armies had three main types of artillery in some case they were subbranches within the artillery branch in others they were separate branches or corps  there were also other types excluding the armament fitted to warships after world war i many nations merged these different artillery branches in some cases keeping some as subbranches  naval artillery disappeared apart from that belonging to marines  however two new branches of artillery emerged during that war and its aftermath both used specialised guns and a few rockets and used direct not indirect fire in the 1950s and 60s both started to make extensive use of missiles however the general switch by artillery to indirect fire before and during world war i led to a reaction in some armies the result was accompanying or infantry guns  these were usually small short range guns that could be easily manhandled and used mostly for direct fire but some could use indirect fire some were operated by the artillery branch but under command of the supported unit  in world war ii they were joined by selfpropelled assault guns although other armies adopted infantry or close support tanks in armoured branch units for the same purpose subsequently tanks generally took on the accompanying role the three main types of artillery gun are guns howitzers and mortars  during the 20th century guns and howitzers have steadily merged in artillery use making a distinction between the terms somewhat meaningless  by the end of the 20th century true guns with calibers larger than about 60mm had become very rare in artillery use the main users being tanks ships and a few residual antiaircraft and coastal guns the traditional definitions differentiated between guns and howitzers in terms of maximum elevation well less than 45 as opposed to close to or greater than 45 number of charges one or more than one charge and having higher or lower muzzle velocity sometimes indicated by barrel length  these three criteria give eight possible combinations of which guns and howitzers are but two  however modern howitzers have higher velocities and longer barrels than the equivalent guns of the first half of the 20th century true guns are characterised by long range having a maximum elevation significantly less than 45 a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel and a single charge the latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case  there is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun thumba british 60pounder convert5 gun at full recoil in action during the battle of gallipoli 1915  photo by ernest brooks howitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to 45 and up to about 70 is normal for modern ones they also have a choice of charges meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used they have lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns  all this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent  because of their multicharge capability their ammunition is mostly separate loading the projectile and propellant are loaded separately that leaves six combinations of the three criteria some of which have been termed gun howitzers a term first used in the 1930s when howitzers with a relatively high maximum muzzle velocities were introduced it never became widely accepted most armies electing to widen the definition of gun or howitzer  by the 1960s most equipments had maximum elevations up to about 70 were multicharge had quite high maximum muzzle velocities and relatively long barrels mortars are simple the modern mortar originated in world war i and there were several patterns  after that war most mortars settled on the stokes pattern characterised by a short barrel smooth bore low muzzle velocity generally firing at an elevation angle greater than 45 and a very simple and light mounting using a baseplate on the ground the projectile with its integral propelling charge was dropped down the barrel from the muzzle to hit a fixed firing pin  since that time a few mortars have become rifled and adopted breech loading there are other recognised typifying characteristics for artillery  first the type of obturation used to seal the chamber and prevent gases escaping through the breech  this may use a metal cartridge case that also holds the propelling charge a configuration called qf or quickfiring by some nations the alternative does not use a metal cartridge case the propellant being merely bagged or in combustible cases with the breech itself providing all the sealing  this is called bl or breech loading by some nations a second characteristic is the form of propulsion  basically modern equipment can either be towed or selfpropelled sp a towed gun fires from the ground and any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield  towing by horse teams lasted throughout world war ii in some armies but others were fully mechanised with wheeled or tracked gun towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war the size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry a variation of towed is portee where the vehicle carries the gun which is dismounted for firing  mortars are often carried this way a mortar is sometimes carried in an armoured vehicle and can either fire from it or be dismounted to fire from the ground  since the early 1960s it has been possible to carry lighter towed guns and most mortars by helicopter  even before that they were parachuted or landed by glider from the time of the first airborne trials in the ussr in the 1930s in an sp equipment the gun is an integral part of the vehicle that carries it  sps first appeared during world war i but did not really develop until world war ii they are mostly tracked vehicles but wheeled sps started to appear in the 1970s some sps have no armour and carry little or no ammunition  armoured sps usually carry a useful ammunition load  early armoured sps were mostly a casemate configuration in essence an open top armoured box offering only limited traverse  however most modern armoured sps have a full enclosed armoured turret usually giving full traverse for the gun  many sps cannot fire without deploying stabilisers or spades sometimes hydraulic a few sps are designed so that the recoil forces of the gun are transferred directly onto the ground through a baseplate a few towed guns have been given limited selfpropulsion by means of an auxiliary engine two other forms of tactical propulsion were used in the first half of the 20th century  railways or transporting the equipment by road as two or three separate loads with disassembly and reassembly at the beginning and end of the journey  railway artillery took two forms railway mountings for heavy and superheavy guns and howitzers and armoured trains as fighting vehicles armed with light artillery in a direct fire role  disassembled transport was also used with heavy and super heavy weapons and lasted into the 1950s a third form of artillery typing is to classify it as light medium heavy and various other terms it appears to have been introduced in world war i which spawned a very wide array of artillery in all sorts of sizes so a simple categorical system was needed some armies defined these categories by bands of calibers  different bands were used for different types of weaponsfield guns mortars antiaircraft guns and coast guns list of countries in order of amount of artillery artillery is used in a variety of roles depending on its type and caliber the general role of artillery is to provide fire supportthe application of fire coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy neutralize or suppress the enemy  this nato definition of course makes artillery a supporting arm although not all nato armies agree with this logic the italicised terms are natos unlike rockets guns or howitzers as some armies still call them and mortars are suitable for delivering close supporting fire  however they are all suitable for providing deep supporting fire although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role  their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to direct supporting fire  guns are used either for this or general supporting fire while rockets are mostly used for the latter  however lighter rockets may be used for direct fire support  these rules of thumb apply to nato armies modern mortars because of their lighter weight and simpler more transportable design are usually an integral part of infantry and in some armies armor units  this means they generally dont have to concentrate their fire so their shorter range is not a disadvantage some armies also consider infantry operated mortars to be more responsive than artillery but this is a function of the control arrangements and not the case in all armies  however mortars have always been used by artillery units and remain with them in many armies including a few in nato in nato armies artillery is usually assigned a tactical mission that establishes its relationship and responsibilities to the formation or units it is assigned to it seems that not all nato nations use the terms and outside nato others are probably used the standard terms are direct support general support general support reinforcing and reinforcing  these tactical missions are in the context of the command authority operational command operational control tactical command or tactical control in nato direct support generally means that the directly supporting artillery unit provides observers and liaison to the manoeuvre troops being supported typically an artillery battalion or equivalent is assigned to a brigade and its batteries to the brigades battalions  however some armies achieve this by placing the assigned artillery units under command of the directly supported formation  nevertheless the batteries fire can be concentrated onto a single target as can the fire of units in range and with the other tactical missions there are several dimensions to this subject the first is the notion that fire may be against an opportunity target or may be prearranged if it is the latter it may be either oncall or scheduled  prearranged targets may be part of a fire plan  fire may be either observed or unobserved if the former it may be adjusted if the latter then it has to be predicted  observation of adjusted fire may be directly by a forward observer or indirectly via some other target acquisition system nato also recognises several different types of fire support for tactical purposes these purposes have existed for most of the 20th century although their definitions have evolved and will continue to do so lack of suppression in counterbattery is an omission  broadly they can be defined as either two other nato terms also need definition the tactical purposes also include various mission verbs a rapidly expanding subject with the modern concept of effects based operations the targeting process is the key aspect of tactical fire control  depending on the circumstances and national procedures it may all be undertaken in one place or may be distributed  in armies practicing control from the front most of the process may be undertaken by a forward observer or other target acquirer  this is particularly the case for a smaller target requiring only a few fire units the extent to which the process is formal or informal and makes use of computer based systems documented norms or experience and judgement also varies widely armies and other circumstances surprise may be essential or irrelevant it depends on what effects are required and whether or not the target is likely to move or quickly improve its protective posture  during world war ii uk researchers concluded that for impact fuzed munitions the relative risk were as follows airburst munitions significantly increase the relative risk for lying men etc  historically most casualties occur in the first 1015 seconds of fire ie the time needed to react and improve protective posture however this is less relevant if airburst is used there are several ways of making best use of this brief window of maximum vulnerability originally counterbattery fire relied on ground or airbased artillery observers noticing the source of the artillery fire due to muzzle flashes smoke spotting the artillery pieces etc and calculating firing solutions to strike back at them  artillery spotting along with reconnaissance was one of the major roles for aircraft in warfare see world war i modern counterbattery fire relies on counterbattery radar which calculate the source of incoming artillery shells very accurately and quicklyso quickly in fact that return fire can sometimes begin before the first enemy shell or rocket has landed the development of fast and accurate counterbattery fire has led to the concept of shootandscoot and concentration on the development of highly mobile artillery pieces typically selfpropelled guns like the us m109 paladin the south african g6 howitzer or soviet army 2s1 gvozdika or rocket artillery like the soviet katyusha or the multinational m270 mlrs the idea is to fire and then move before any counterbattery fire can land on the original position the task of destroying enemy artillery batteries can also fall to attack aircraft but unless they are already on patrol overhead they are usually not quick enough to save friendly forces from damage  more often groundbased counterbattery fire would suppress the enemy batterybatteries and force them to move while aircraft would follow up later with a strike to destroy the rest of the enemy artillery modern field artillery postworld war i has three distinct parts the forward observer or fo the fire direction center fdc and the actual guns themselves the forward observer observes the target using tools such as binoculars laser rangefinders designators and call back fire missions on his radio or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping the fo can communicate directly with the battery fdc of which there is one per each battery of 48 guns  otherwise the several fos communicate with a higher fdc such as at a battalion level and the higher fdc prioritizes the targets and allocates fires to individual batteries as needed to engage the targets that are spotted by the fos or to perform preplanned fires the battery fdc computes firing dataammunition to be used powder charge fuse settings the direction to the target and the quadrant elevation to be fired at to reach the target what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target and the number of rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately locatedto the guns  traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting direction and the elevation needed to reach the target and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect ffe however in more advanced artillery units this data is relayed through a digital radio link other parts of the field artillery team include meteorological analysis to determine the temperature humidity and pressure of the air and wind direction and speed at different altitudes  also radar is used both for determining the location of enemy artillery and mortar batteries and to determine the precise actual strike points of rounds fired by battery and comparing that location with what was expected to compute a registration allowing future rounds to be fired with much greater accuracy a technique called time on target was developed by the us army during world war ii this technique uses a precise determination of the time of flight from each firing battery to the target area  when a time on target tot is designated each battery that will join in firing on that target subtracts the time of flight from the tot to determine the time to fire  individual firing batteries train to fire their rounds as close to simultaneously as possible  when each firing battery fires their rounds at their individual time to fire every round will reach the target area nearly simultaneously  this is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires a similar effect may be obtained by a single battery firing sequential rounds with different trajectories with all rounds timed to arrive simultaneously this is a modern version of the earlier time on target concept in which fire from different weapons was timed to arrive on target at the same time it is possible for modern computercontrolled artillery to fire more than one volley at a target and have all the shells arrive simultaneously which is called mrsi multiple rounds simultaneous impact this is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it and by varying the amount of propellant with each shell it is possible to create multiple trajectories  because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories the shells will all arrive at the same time  this is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning  with traditional volleys along the same trajectory anybody at the target point will have a certain amount of time however long it takes to reload and refire the guns to run away or take cover between volleys in addition if guns in more than one location are firing on one target with careful timing it can be arranged for all their shells to land at the same time for the same reason examples of mrsi guns are south africas denel g652 which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least convert25 away germanys panzerhaubitze 2000 which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least convert17 away and slovakias  155mm spgh zuzana model 2000  the archer project developed by baesystems in sweden a 155mm howitzer on a wheeled chassis claiming to be able to deliver up to 7 shells on target simultaneously from the same gun the 120mm twin barrel amos mortar system developed in finland is capable of 7  7 shells mrsi the united states crusader program now canceled was slated to have mrsi capability tworound mrsi firings were a popular artillery demonstration in the 1960s where well trained crews could show off their skills for spectators the destructiveness of artillery bombardments can be enhanced when some or all of the shells are set for airburst meaning that they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact  this can be accomplished either through time fuses or proximity fuses  time fuses use a precise timer to detonate the shell after a preset delay  unfortunately this technique is tricky and slight variations in the functioning of the fuse can cause it to explode too high and be ineffective or to strike the ground instead of exploding above it  since december 1944 battle of the bulge proximity fused artillery shells have been available that take the guesswork out of this process  these embody a miniature weak radar transmitter in the fuse to detect the ground and explode them at a predetermined height above it the return of the weak radar signal completes an electrical circuit in the fuse which explodes the shell this is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles because it scatters the fragmentation of the shell over a larger area and prevents it from being blocked by terrain or entrenchments that do not include some form of robust overhead cover  combined with tot or mrsi tactics that give no warning of the incoming rounds these rounds are especially devastating because many enemy soldiers are likely to be caught in the open  this is even more so if the attack is launched against an assembly area or troops moving in the open rather than a unit in an entrenched tactical position', 'abbamari the descendant of men learned in rabbinic lore abba mari devoted himself to the study of theology and philosophy and made himself acquainted with the writings of moses maimonides and nachmanides as well as with the talmud in montpellier where he lived from 1303 to 1306 he was much distressed by the prevalence of aristotelian rationalism which in his opinion through the medium of the works of maimonides threatened the authority of the old testament obedience to the law and the belief in miracles and revelation he therefore in a series of letters afterwards collected under the title minhat kenaot ie jealousy offering called upon the famous rabbi solomon ben adret of barcelona to come to the aid of orthodoxy  ben adret with the approval of other prominent spanish rabbis sent a letter to the community at montpellier proposing to forbid the study of philosophy to those who were less than twentyfive years of age and in spite of keen opposition from the liberal section a decree in this sense was issued by ben adret in 1305   the result was a great schism among the jews of spain and southern france and a new impulse was given to the study of philosophy by the unauthorized interference of the spanish rabbis on the expulsion of the jews from france by philip iv in 1306 abba mari settled at perpignan where he published the letters connected with the controversy  his subsequent history is unknown   beside the letters he was the author of liturgical poetry and works on civil law abba mari possessed considerable talmudic knowledge and some poetical talent but his zeal for the law made him an agitator and a persecutor of all the advocates of liberal thought  being himself without sufficient authority he appealed in a number of letters afterward published under the title of minat enaot jealousy offering to solomon ben adret of barcelona the most influential rabbi of the time to use his powerful authority to check the source of evil by hurling his anathema against both the study of philosophy and the allegorical interpretations of the bible which did away with all belief in miracles  ben adret while reluctant to interfere in the affairs of other congregations was in perfect accord with abba mari as to the danger of the new rationalistic systems and advised him to organize the conservative forces in defense of the law abba mari through ben adrets aid obtained allies eager to take up his cause among whom were don bonafoux vidal of barcelona and his brother don crescas vidal then in perpignan the proposition of the latter to prohibit under penalty of excommunication the study of philosophy and any of the sciences except medicine by one under thirty years of age met with the approval of ben adret accordingly ben adret addressed to the congregation of montpellier a letter signed by fifteen other rabbis proposing to issue a decree pronouncing the anathema against all those who should pursue the study of philosophy and science before due maturity in age and in rabbinical knowledge  on a sabbath in september 1304 the letter was to be read before the congregation when jacob machir don profiat tibbon the renowned astronomical and mathematical writer entered his protest against such unlawful interference by the barcelona rabbis and a schism ensued  twentyeight members signed abba maris letter of approval the others under tibbons leadership addressed another letter to ben adret rebuking him and his colleagues for condemning a whole community without knowledge of the local conditions  finally the agitation for and against the liberal ideas brought about a schism in the entire jewish population in southern france and spain encouraged however by letters signed by the rabbis of argentire and lunel and particularly by the support of kalonymus ben todros the nasi of narbonne and of the eminent talmudist asheri of toledo ben adret issued a decree signed by thirtythree rabbis of barcelona excommunicating those who should within the next fifty years study physics or metaphysics before their thirtieth year of age basing his action on the principle laid down by maimonides guide for the perplexed part one chapter 34 and had the order promulgated in the synagogue on sabbath july 26 1305  when this heresydecree to be made effective was forwarded to other congregations for approval the friends of liberal thought under the leadership of the tibbonites issued a counterban and the conflict threatened to assume a serious character as blind party zeal this time on the liberal side did not shrink from asking the civil powers to intervene but an unlookedfor calamity brought the warfare to an end the expulsion of the jews from france by philip iv the fair in  caused the jews of montpellier to take refuge partly in provence partly in perpignan and partly in majorca consequently abba mari removed first to arles and within the same year to perpignan where he finally settled and disappeared from public view  there he published his correspondence with ben adret and his colleagues abba mari collected the correspondence and added to each letter a few explanatory notes  of this collection called minat enaot there are several manuscript copies extant namely at oxford neubauer cat bodl hebr mss nos 2182 and 2221 paris bibl nat no 976 gnzburg libr saint petersburg parma ramsgate montefiore college library formerly halberstam no 192 and turin some of these oxford no 2221 and paris bibl nat are mere fragments the printed edition presburg 1838 prepared by m l bislichis contains 1 preface 2 a treatise of eighteen chapters on the incorporeality of god 3 correspondence 4 a treatise called sefer hayari included also in letter 58 5 a defense of the guide and its author by shemtob palquera grtz gesch d  juden vii 173  as the three cardinal doctrines of judaism abba mari accentuates 1 that of the recognition of gods existence and of his absolute sovereignty eternity unity and incorporeality as taught in revelation especially in the decalogue 2 that of the worlds creation by him out of nothing as evidenced particularly by the sabbath 3 that of the special providence of god as manifested in the biblical miracles  in the preface abba mari explains his object in collecting the correspondence and in the treatise which follows he shows that the study of philosophy useful in itself as a help toward the acquisition of the knowledge of god requires great caution lest we be misled by the aristotelian philosophy or its false interpretation as regards the principles of creation ex nihilo and divine individual providence the manuscripts include twelve letters which are not included in the printed edition of minat enaot the correspondence refers mainly to the proposed restriction of the study of the aristotelian philosophy  casually other theological questions are discussed  for example letters 1 5 and 8 contain a discussion on the question whether the use of a piece of metal with the figure of a lion as a talisman is permitted by jewish law for medicinal purposes or is prohibited as idolatrous  in letter 131 abba mari mourns the death of ben adret and in letter 132 he sends words of sympathy to the congregation of perpignan on the death of don vidal shlomo the meiri and rabbi meshullam letter 33 contains the statement of abba mari that two letters which he desired to insert could not be discovered by him  ms ramsgate no 52 has the same statement but also the two letters missing in the printed copies  in the sefer hayari abba mari refers to the great caution shown by the rabbis of old as regards the teaching of the mysteries of philosophy and recommended by men like the hai gaon maimonides and david kimhi a response of abba mari on a ritual question is contained in ms ramsgate no 136 and zunz literaturgeschichte der synagogalen poesie p498 mentions a inah composed by abba mari the minat enaot is instructive reading for the historian because it throws much light upon the deeper problems which agitated judaism the question of the relation of religion to the philosophy of the age which neither the zeal of the fanatic nor the bold attitude of the liberalminded could solve in any fixed dogmatic form or by any anathema as the independent spirit of the congregations refused to accord to the rabbis the power possessed by the church of dictating to the people what they should believe or respect  at the close of the work are added several eulogies written by abba mari on ben adret who died in 1310 and on don vidal solomon of perpignan and don bonet crescas of lunel', 'abdallatifalbaghdadimedievalwriter an interesting memoir of abdallatif written by himself has been preserved with additions by ibn abuosaiba ibn abi usaibia a contemporary  from that work we learn that the higher education of the youth of baghdad consisted principally in a minute and careful study of the rules and principles of grammar and in their committing to memory the whole of the quran a treatise or two on philology and jurisprudence and the choicest arabic poetry after attaining to great proficiency in that kind of learning abdallatif applied himself to natural philosophy and medicine  to enjoy the society of the learned he went first to mosul 1189 and afterwards to damascus with letters of recommendation from saladins vizier he visited egypt where he realized his wish to converse with maimonides he afterwards formed one of the circles of learned men whom saladin gathered around him at jerusalem he taught medicine and philosophy at cairo and at damascus for a number of years and afterwards for a shorter period at aleppo his love of travel led him to visit different parts of armenia and asia minor in his old age  also he was in the process of setting out on a pilgrimage to mecca when he died at baghdad abdallatif was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind  of the numerous works mostly on medicine which osaiba ascribes to him one only his graphic and detailed account of egypt in two parts appears to be known in europe abdal latif was well aware of the value of ancient monuments and praised muslim rulers for preserving and protecting preislamic artifacts and monuments he noted that the preservation of antiquities presented a number of benefits for muslims while discussing the profession of treasure hunting he notes that poorer treasure hunters were often sponsored by rich businessmen to go on archeological expeditions  in some cases an expedition could turn out to be fraud with the treasure hunter disappearing with large amounts of money extracted from sponsors  this fraudulent practice continues to the present day with rich businessmen in egypt still being deceived by local treasure hunters this work was one of the earliest works on egyptology it contains a vivid description of a famine caused during the authors residence in egypt by the nile failing to overflow its banks he also wrote detailed descriptions on ancient egyptian monuments albaghdadi wrote that during the famine in egypt in 597 ah 1200 ad he had the opportunity to observe and examine a large number of skeletons  this was one of the earliest examples of a postmortem autopsy through which he discovered that galen was incorrect regarding the formation of the bones of the lower jaw and sacrum the arabic manuscript was discovered in 1665 by edward pococke the orientalist and preserved in the bodleian library he then published the arabic manuscript in the 1680s  his son edward pococke the younger translated the work into latin though he was only able to publish less than half of his work  thomas hunt attempted to publish pocockes complete translation in 1746 though his attempt was unsuccessful  pocockes complete latin translation was eventually published by joseph white of oxford in 1800  the work was then translated into french with valuable notes by silvestre de sacy in 1810 albaghdadis mukhtarat fi altibb was one of the earliest works on hirudotherapy he introduced a more modern use for medicinal leech stating that leech could be used for cleaning the tissues after surgical operations he did however understand that there is a risk over using leech and advised patients that leech need to be cleaned before being used and that the dirt or dust clinging to a leech should be wiped off before application he further writes that after the leech has sucked out the blood salt should be sprinkled on the affected part of the human body he wrote a book called altibb min alkitab waalsunna medicine from the book and the life of the prophet describing the islamic medical practices from the time of muhammad albaghdadi was also the author of a

argument that observations of the physical universe must be compatible with the conscious life that observes it some proponents of the argument reason that it explains why the universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life  as a result they believe that the fact that the universes fundamental constants are within the narrow range thought to allow life is not remarkable the principle was formulated as a response to a series of observations that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life as observed on earth the anthropic principle states that this phenomenon is a necessity because living observers wouldnt be able to exist and hence observe the universe were these laws and constants not constituted in this way the term anthropic in anthropic principle has been argued  to be a misnomer   while singling out our kind of carbonbased life none of the finely tuned phenomena require human life or demand that carbonbased life develop intelligence however the detection and formulation of this principle born from a long and laborious history of scientific observations trials and errors studying ingenuity and inventions of necessary instrumentation does make this an intellectual domain exclusive to humans above all other life forms on earth and beyond so far as science has observed  both the scientific principles and the intelligence required for their detection are nonmaterial phenomena and transcend carbonbased life forms which said nonmaterial phenomena give rise to in the first place through the observed scientific principles and laws governing them moment by moment the anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas  all versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe  those attempting to explain the anthropic principle often invoke ideas of multiple universes or an intelligent designer both controversial and criticized for being untestable and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is more of a philosophical concept not a scientific one  one way to bypass the controversy is to emphasize the weak anthropic principle  conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist  in mathematics and philosophy the weak form of a statement is one which is easier to support eg it makes fewer claims of substance  even critics of the weak anthropic principle recognize that it is a tautology or truism   however building up other substantive arguments based on a tautological foundation is problematic   stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and make substantive claims which may be considered controversial by some in 1961 robert dicke noted that the age of the universe as seen by living observers cannot be random  instead biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a golden age neither too young nor too old if the universe were one tenth as old as its present age there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of metallicity levels of elements besides hydrogen and helium especially carbon by nucleosynthesis   small rocky planets did not yet exist if the universe were 10 times older than it actually is most stars would be too old to remain on the main sequence and would have turned into white dwarfs aside from the dimmest red dwarfs and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end  thus dicke explained away the rough coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe a coincidence which had inspired diracs varyingg theory dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the critical density needed to prevent the big crunch the dicke coincidences argument the most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of baryonic matter and some theoretical predictions of the amount of dark matter account for about 30 of this critical density with the rest contributed by a cosmological constant  steven weinberg gave an anthropic explanation for this fact he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value some 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the value particle physics predicts this is described as the worst prediction in physics  however if the cosmological constant were more than about 10 times its observed value the universe would suffer catastrophic inflation which would preclude the formation of stars and hence life the observed values of the dimensionless physical constants such as the finestructure constant governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if finetuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life a slight increase in the strong nuclear force would bind the dineutron and the diproton and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium  water and the longlived stable stars essential for the emergence of life would not exist  more generally small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universes age structure and capacity for life the phrase anthropic principle first appeared in brandon carters contribution to a 1973 krakw symposium honouring copernicuss 500th birthday  carter a theoretical astrophysicist articulated the anthropic principle in reaction to the copernican principle which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the universe as carter said  although our situation is not necessarily central it is inevitably privileged to some extent  specifically carter disagreed with using the copernican principle to justify the perfect cosmological principle which states that all large regions and times in the universe must be statistically identical the latter principle underlay the steadystate theory which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation  this discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time for example via the big bang carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle a weak one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged spacetime locations in the universe and a more controversial strong form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics roger penrose explained the weak form as follows one reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves but when applying the strong principle we only have one universe with one set of fundamental parameters so what exactly is the point being made  carter offers two possibilities  first we can use our own existence to make predictions about the parameters but second as a last resort we can convert these predictions into explanations by assuming that there is more than one universe in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes something that is now called a multiverse world ensemble was carters term in which the parameters and perhaps the laws of physics vary across universes the strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect exactly analogous to the weak principle  postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another since carters 1973 paper the term anthropic principle has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused  particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the influential book the anthropic cosmological principle by john d barrow and frank tipler published that year which distinguished between weak and strong anthropic principle in a way very different from carters as discussed in the next section carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle  in fact the evolutionary biologist alfred russel wallace anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904  such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us may have been absolutely required in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man  in 1957 robert dicke wrote  the age of the universe now is not random but conditioned by biological factors changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem in their 1986 book the anthropic cosmological principle john barrow and frank tipler depart from carter and define the wap and sap as follows the philosophers john leslie and nick bostrom reject the barrow and tipler sap as a fundamental misreading of carter for bostrom carters anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for anthropic bias that is the bias created by anthropic selection effects which bostrom calls observation selection effects  the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result he writes according to jrgen schmidhuber the anthropic principle essentially just says that the conditional probability of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1  it does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as gravity wont change tomorrow  to gain more predictive power additional assumptions on the prior distribution of alternative universes are necessary playwright and novelist michael frayn describes a form of the strong anthropic principle in his 2006 book the human touch which explores what he characterises as the central oddity of the universe carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas which has resulted in much confusion  in fact anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the fundamental parameters  that is the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the big bang carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes  in other words the universe we are in is fine tuned to permit life  collins  hawking 1973 characterise carters thenunpublished big idea as the postulate that there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions if this is granted the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe the typical universe is not finetuned but given enough universes a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life  ours must be one of these and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder but how seriously can we take the multiverse  and which specific multiverse should we assume  this question must be answered before any quantitative anthropic predictions can be made   although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics  this would allow variation in initial conditions but not in the truly fundamental constants  since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested see the review by max tegmark an important development in the 1980s was the combination of inflation theory with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by symmetry breaking in the early universe which allows parameters previously thought of as fundamental constants to vary over very large distances thus eroding the distinction between carters weak and strong principles  at the beginning of the 21st century the string landscape emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants including the number of spatial dimensions the anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities each actual in some universe or other contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters as einstein said what really interests me is whether god had any choice in the creation of the world  quite recently proponents of the leading candidate for a theory of everything string theory proclaimed the end of the anthropic principle since there would be no free parameters to select  ironically string theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well see below the modern form of a design argument is put forth by intelligent design  proponents of intelligent design often cite the finetuning observations that in part preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by carter as a proof of an intelligent designer  opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist they may also argue antianthropically that the universe is less finetuned than often claimed or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator  furthermore even accepting fine tuning sober 2005 and ikeda and jefferys argue that the anthropic principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design see finetuned universe paul daviess book the goldilocks enigma 2006 reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate omitted here is lee smolins model of cosmological natural selection also known as fecund universes which proposes that universes have offspring which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe  also see gardner 2005 clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle while leaving others unanswered  followers of carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of barrow and tiplers sap which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4 as in tipler 1994 the anthropic principle at least as carter conceived it can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe  for example carter 1983 inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record one must take into account cosmological and astrophysical considerations  with this in mind carter concluded that given the best estimates of the age of the universe the evolutionary chain culminating in homo sapiens probably admits only one or two low probability links  antonio feoli and salvatore rampone dispute this conclusion arguing instead that the estimated size of our universe and the number of planets in it allows for a higher bound so that there is no need to invoke intelligent design to explain evolution no possible observational evidence bears on carters wap as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable the obvious test of barrows sap which says that the universe is required to support life is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours  however as any other universe is by definition unobservable otherwise it would be part of our universe this test cannot be carried out and barrows sap is untestable philosopher john leslie states that the carter sap with multiverse predicts the following hogan has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning  in fact we might have to resort to something akin to barrow and tiplers sap there would be no option for such a universe not to support life probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given the probability of observing value x is then proportional to nx px one thing that would not count as evidence for the anthropic principle is evidence  that the earth or the solar system occupied a privileged position in the universe in violation of the copernican principle for possible counterevidence to this principle see copernican principle unless there was some reason to think that that position was a necessary condition for our existence as observers fred hoyle invoked anthropic reasoning to make a remarkable prediction of an astrophysical phenomenon he reasoned from the prevalence on earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on carbon12 atoms that there must be an undiscovered resonance in the carbon12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the triplealpha process he then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 76 million electronvolts university of birmingham httpwwwnpphbhamacukresearchanthropichtm life bent chains and the anthropic principle willie fowlers research group soon found this resonance and its measured energy was close to hoyles prediction however a recently released paper argues that hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction page criticized the entire theory of cosmic inflation as follows he emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic arrow of time in a universe with a big bang origin must include the assumption that at the initial singularity the entropy of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable  paul davies rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle  while davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating had to possess a very low entropy value  due to random quantum fluctuations  to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory  that the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly to allow the postinflation universe to have an arrow of time makes it unnecessary to adopt any ad hoc hypotheses about the initial entropy state hypotheses other big bang theories require string theory predicts a large number of possible universes called the backgrounds or vacua the set of these vacua is often called the multiverse or anthropic landscape or string landscape  leonard susskind has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed steven weinberg believes the anthropic principle may be appropriated by cosmologists committed to nontheism and refers to that principle as a turning point in modern science because applying it to the string landscapemay explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being finetuned by a benevolent creator  others most notably david gross but also lubos motl peter woit and lee smolin argue that this is not predictive  max tegmark mario livio and martin rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable andor testable for the theory to be accepted and that many wellaccepted theories are far from completely testable at present jrgen schmidhuber 20002002 points out that ray solomonoffs theory of universal inductive inference and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory given a limited sequence of physical observations and some prior distribution on the set of possible explanations of the universe when water freezes into ice the ice floats because ice is less dense than liquid water  this is one possible example of the anthropic principle because if ice did not float it might have been difficult or impossible for living organisms to have existed in water without the insulating properties of a top ice layer lakes and ponds would tend to freeze solid and thaw very little during warmer periods   though this principle has been criticized as neglecting the existence of the tropical zone and other warmer climates ice is unusual in that it is approximately 9 less dense than liquid water  water is the only known nonmetallic substance to expand when it freezes the density of ice is 09167 gcm at 0c whereas water has a density of 09998 gcm at the same temperature  liquid water is densest essentially 100 gcm at 4c and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals of ice as the freezing point is reached  this is due to hydrogen bonding dominating the intermolecular forces which results in a packing of molecules less compact in the solid the most thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book the anthropic cosmological principle by john d barrow a cosmologist and frank j tipler a mathematical physicist  this book sets out in great detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints including many found by its authors  while the book is primarily a work of theoretical astrophysics it also touches on quantum physics chemistry and earth science an entire chapter argues that homo sapiens is with high probability the only intelligent species in the milky way the book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the history of ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of teleology and intelligent design they discuss the writings of fichte hegel bergson and alfred north whitehead and the omega point cosmology of teilhard de chardin barrow and tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from eutaxiological reasoning the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause they attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by l e hicks seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction barrow and tipler propose the barrow and tipler submit that the fap is both a valid physical statement and closely connected with moral values fap places strong constraints on the structure of the universe constraints developed further in tiplers the physics of immortality one such constraint is that the universe must end in a big crunch which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about dark energy based on observations of very distant supernovas in his review of barrow and tipler martin gardner ridiculed the fap by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a completely ridiculous anthropic principle crap in fairness to the authors they state at the outset that they are not necessarily committed to the ideas they describe and admit that the sap and fap are quite speculative carter himself has frequently regretted his own choice of the word anthropic because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically rather than intelligent observers in general  others have criticised the word principle as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of selection effects a common criticism of carters sap is that it is an easy deus ex machina which discourages searches for physical explanations  to quote penrose again it tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts carters sap and barrow and tiplers wap have been dismissed as truisms or tautologies that is statements true solely by virtue of their logical form the conclusion is identical to the premise and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality  as such they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying if things were different they would be different which is a valid statement but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another the anthropic principles implicitly posit that our ability to ponder cosmology at all is contingent on one or more fundamental physical constants having numerical values falling within quite a narrow range and this is not a tautology nor is postulating a multiverse  moreover working out the consequences of a change in the fundamental constants for the existence of our species is far from trivial and as we have seen can lead to quite unexpected constraints on physical theory  this reasoning does however demonstrate that carbonbased life is impossible under these altered fundamental parameters critics of the barrow and tipler sap claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one the same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions a modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life especially intelligent life that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe  also the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle such as barrett and tiplers anthropic cosmological principle which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a necessary prerequisite for the observable constants of physics  in a lecture titled the confusion of cause and effect in bad science the paleophysicist caroline miller said similarly stephen jay gould some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life sometimes called carbon chauvinism see also alternative biochemistry the range of fundamental physical constants consistent with the evolution of carbonbased life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine tuned universe have argued  for instance harnik et al propose a weakless universe in which the weak nuclear force is eliminated they show that this has no significant effect on the other fundamental interactions provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work  however if some of the finetuned details of our universe were violated that would rule out complex structures of any kind  stars planets galaxies etc lee smolin has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of he puts forth his fecund universes theory which assumes universes have offspring through the creation of black holes and that these offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on these of the mother universe some versions of the anthropic principle are only interesting if the range of physical constants that allow certain kinds of life are unlikely in a landscape of possible universes but lee smolin assumes that conditions for carbon based life are similar to conditions for black hole creation which would change the a priori distribution of universes such that universes containing life would be likely  in  the string theorist leonard susskind disagrees about some assumptions in lee smolins theory while smolin defends his theory the philosophers of cosmology john earman ernan mcmullin  and jess mostern contend that in its weak version the anthropic principle is a mere tautology which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know  in its strong version it is a gratuitous speculation a further criticism by mostern concerns the flawed anthropic inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours', 'anxiolytic betareceptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol although not anxiolytics can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety anxiolytics are also known as minor tranquilizers though their use and effects are by no means minor most anxiolytic medications are extremely potent the term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with major tranquilizers also known as neuroleptics or antipsychotics benzodiazepines are prescribed for shortterm relief of severe and disabling anxiety  benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder they are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when shortterm cns sedation is needed  longerterm uses include treatment for severe anxiety  there is a risk of a benzodiazepine withdrawal and rebound syndrome after continuous usage for longer than two weeks and tolerance and dependence may occur if patients stay under this treatment for longer  there is also the added problem of the accumulation of drug metabolites and adverse effects  benzodiazepines include benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage  at higher dosage hypnotic properties occur azapirones are a class of 5ht1a receptor agonists they lack the sedation and the dependence associated with benzodiazepines and cause much less cognitive impairment they may be less effective than benzodiazepines in patients who have been previously treated with benzodiazepines as they do not provide the sedation that these patients may expect or equate with anxiety relief  currently approved azapirones include buspirone buspar and tandospirone sediel gepirone ariza variza is also in clinical development barbiturates exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause the risk of abuse and addiction is high  many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the shortterm treatment of severe insomnia though only after benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepines have failed they are rarely prescribed anymore hydroxyzine atarax is an old antihistamine originally approved for clinical use by the fda in 1956  it possesses anxiolytic properties in addition to its antihistamine properties and is also licensed for the treatment of anxiety and tension it is also used for its sedative properties as a premed before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia it has been shown to be as effective as benzodiazepines in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder while producing fewer side effects pregabalins therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to lorazepam alprazolam and venlafaxine but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms  longterm trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance and additionally unlike benzodiazepines it does not disrupt sleep architecture and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons certain herbs are reputed to have anxiolytic properties including the following of these only kava and brahmi have shown anxiolytic effects in randomized clinical trials and only kavas effect has been independently replicated in mice trials have shown anxiolytic effects at 50mgkg  however an increase in the dose of n persica exerted stimulation rather than sedation as is the case for many other herbs a team from brazil found cannabidiol a constituent of cannabis also called cbd to be an effective antipsychotic and anxiolytic  cbd induced a clear anxiolytic effect and a pattern of cerebral activity compatible with anxiolytic activity  therefore similar to the data obtained in animal models results from studies on healthy volunteers have strongly suggested an anxiolyticlike effect of cbd pineapple sage or salvia elegans is used as a treatment for anxiety in traditional mexican medicine and a preliminary study on mice has yielded some support for both anxiolytic and antidepressant properties chlorpheniramine chlortrimeton and diphenhydramine benadryl have hypnotic and sedative effects with mild anxiolyticlike propertiesofflabel use   these drugs are approved by the fda for allergies rhinitis and urticaria due to deficits with existing anxiolytics either in terms of efficacy or sideeffect profile research into novel anxiolytics is active  possible candidates for future drugs include psychotherapeutic treatment can be an effective alternative to medication  exposure therapy is the recommended treatment for phobic anxiety disorders  cognitive behavioral therapy cbt has been found to be effective treatment for panic disorder social anxiety disorder generalized anxiety disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder  healthcare providers can also help by educating suffers about anxiety disorders and referring individuals to self help resources  cbt has been shown to be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and possibly more effective than pharmacological treatments in the long term  sometimes medication is combined with psychotherapy but research has found that there is no benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy versus monotherapy', 'anoa both are found on the island of sulawesi in indonesia the mountain anoa is also found on the nearby island of buton they apparently live singly or in pairs rather than herds except when the cows are about to give birth  one young is born per year both species of anoa have been classified as endangered since the 1960s and the population continues to decrease it is believed unlikely that there are more than 5000 animals of each species remaining   reasons for the decline of the anoa include hunting for hide horns and meat by the local peoples and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement   currently hunting is the more serious factor in most areas mountain anoa are also known as anoa de montana anoa de quarle anoa des montagnes anoa pegunungan and quarles anoa lowland anoa are also known as anoa de ilanura or anoa des plaines they are also called sapiutan or sapi utan lowland anoa stand barely over 90 cm at the shoulder and is the most diminutive of all wild cattle it is most closely allied to the larger asiatic buffaloes showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on the back the horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes  white spots are sometimes present below the eyes and there may be white markings on the legs and back and the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races the horns of the cows are very small the nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes of which

the bawdy story of a slave named pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door the plot displays many classic elements of farce including puns the slamming of doors cases of mistaken identity frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another and satirical comments on social class the title derives from the line that vaudeville comedians often used to begin a story  a funny thing happened on the way to the theater the musicals original 1962 broadway run won several tony awards including best musical and best book a funny thing has enjoyed several broadway and west end revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the play zero mostel it is a popular choice for school and community theatre the shows creators originally wanted phil silvers in the lead role of pseudolus but he turned them down allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit  silvers went on to play the role in a 1972 revival milton berle also passed on the role   eventually zero mostel was cast during the out of town prebroadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well  jerome robbins was called in by director george abbott and producer hal prince to give advice and make changes the

at cloc the college light opera company httpwwwcollegelightoperacompanycom in ancient rome some neighbors live in three adjacent houses   in the center is the house of senex who lives there with wife domina son hero and several slaves including head slave hysterium and the musicals main character pseudolus a slave belonging to hero he wishes to buy win or steal his freedom  one of the neighboring houses is owned by marcus lycus who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women the other belongs to the ancient erronius who is abroad searching for his longlost children stolen in infancy by pirates one day senex and domina go on a trip and leave pseudolus in charge of hero hero confides in pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely philia one of the courtesans in the house of lycus pseudolus promises to help him win philias love in exchange for his freedom   unfortunately as the two find out when they pay a visit on lycus philia has been promised to the renowned warrior captain miles gloriosus who is on his way to claim her   pseudolus an excellent liar uses philias cheery disposition to convince lycus that she has picked up a plague from crete which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages   by offering to isolate her in senexs house he is able to give philia and hero some time alone together and the two fall in love but philia insists that even though she is in love with hero she must honor her contract with the captain for that is the way of a courtesan   to appease her he tells her to wait thats what virgins do best isnt it inside and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives   pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious he will then tell lycus that she has died of the cretan plague and will offer to remove the body   hero will come along and they will stow away on a ship headed for greece satisfied with his plan pseudolus steals hysteriums book of potions and has hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion the only ingredient he lacks is mares sweat and pseudolus goes off in search of some unexpectedly senex returns home early from his trip and knocks three times on his own door   philia comes out of the house and thinking that senex is the captain offers herself up to him   surprised but game senex instructs philia to wait in the house for him and she does   hysterium arrives to this confusion and tells senex that philia is the new maid that he has hired   pseudolus returns having procured the necessary mares sweat seeing that senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horsesweat onto him then suggests that the road trip has left senex in dire need of a bath   taking the bait senex instructs hysterium to draw him a bath in the longabandoned house of erronius but while this is happening erronius returns home finally having given up the search for his longlost children   hysterium desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing tells the old man that his house has become haunteda story seemingly confirmed by the sound of senex singing in his bath   erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house and pseudolus obligingly poses as one telling erronius that in order to banish the spirit he must travel seven times around the seven hills of rome thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while when miles gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesanbride pseudolus hides philia on the roof of senexs house told that she has escaped lycus is terrified to face the captains wrath   pseudolus offers to impersonate lycus and talk his way out of the mess but his ingenuity flagging he ends up merely telling the captain that philia has disappeared and that he lycus will set out in search of her   displeased and suspicious miles insists that his soldiers accompany pseudolus but the wily slave is able to lose them in romes winding streets complicating matters further domina returns from her trip early suspicious that her husband senex is up to something low she disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil much like philias in order to try and catch senex being unfaithful   pseudolus convinces hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be philia dead from the plague   unfortunately it turns out that miles gloriosus has just returned from crete where there is of course no actual plague   with the ruse thus revealed the main characters run for their lives resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both miles and senex pursuing all three philias domina hysterium and the actual philia  all wearing identical white robes and veils  meanwhile the courtesans from the house of marcus lycus  who had been recruited as mourners at philias ersatz funeral  have escaped and lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back adding to the general pandemonium finally the captains troops are able to round everyone up   his plot thoroughly unraveled pseudolus appears to be in deep troublebut erronius midway through his fourth circuit of the roman hills shows up fortuitously to discover that miles gloriosus and philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his longlost children   her betrothal to the captain obviously nullified by the unexpected revelation that hes actually her brother philia weds hero pseudolus gets his freedom gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace philia erronius gets his children and a general happy ending prevails note the song love is in the air was originally intended as the opening number the song was cut from the show and replaced with comedy tonight the song was later featured in the film the birdcage 1996 and performed by robin williams and christine baranski in the second season of the amc series mad men which takes place in 1962 several characters refer to the play   for example don draper runs into his former mistress rachel menken at sardis   rachel and her new husband are on their way to see the show on broadway', 'arithmeticgeometricmean first compute the arithmetic mean of x and y and call it a1  next compute the geometric mean of x and y and call it g1 this is the square root of the product xy then iterate this operation with a1 taking the place of x and g1 taking the place of y  in this way two sequences an and gn are defined these two sequences converge to the same number which is the arithmeticgeometric mean of x and y it is denoted by mx y or sometimes by agmx y this can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the agm method to find the arithmeticgeometric mean of a0  24 and g0  6 first calculate their arithmetic mean and geometric mean thus the first four iterations give the following values the arithmeticgeometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences which is approximately 1345817148173 the geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean see inequality of arithmetic and geometric means as a consequence gn is an increasing sequence an is a decreasing sequence and gnmxyan  these are strict inequalities if xy mx y is thus a number between the geometric and arithmetic mean of x and y in particular it is between x andy if r0 then mrxryrmxy there is an integralform expression for mxy indeed since the arithmeticgeometric process converges so quickly it provides an effective way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula the reciprocal of the arithmeticgeometric mean of 1 and the square root of 2 is called gausss constant the geometricharmonic mean can be calculated by an analogous method using sequences of geometric and harmonic means the arithmeticharmonic mean can be similarly defined but takes the same value as the geometric mean from inequality of arithmetic and geometric means we can conclude that furthermore it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of x and y which follows from the fact that both arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers both lie between them   thus by the monotone convergence theorem the sequence is convergent so there exists a g such that however we can also see that qed', 'afrobeat the new sound hailed from a club that he established called the afroshrine upon arriving in nigeria kuti also changed the name of his group to africa 70  the band maintained a fiveyear residency in the afroshrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among nigerian youth  afrobeat is now one of the most recognizable music genres in the world and has influenced as many western musicians as it has african ones with its exuberant style and polyrhythms afrobeat originated from the southern part of nigeria in the 1960s where kuti experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time  prevalent in his and lagbajas music are native african harmonies and rhythms taking different elements and combining modernizing and improvising upon them  politics are essential to afrobeat since founder kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change  his message can be described as confrontational and controversial which can be related to the political climate of most of the african countries in the 1960s many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to selfdetermination  as the genre spread throughout the african continent many bands took up the style the recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on compilation albums and cds from specialist record shops big band 15 to 30 pieces  felaera afrobeat and energetic performances many jazz musicians have been attracted to afrobeat  from roy ayers in the 1970s to randy weston in the 1990s there have been collaborations which have resulted in albums such as africa centre of the world by roy ayers released on the polydore label in 1981  in 1994 branford marsalis the american jazz saxophonist included samples of felas beast of no nation on his buckshot lefonque album the new generation of djs and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both kutis material and other rare releases have made compilations and remixes of these recordings thus reintroducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of afropop and groove afrobeat has profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like brian eno and david byrne who credit fela kuti as an essential muse  both worked on talking heads highlyacclaimed 1980 album remain in light which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to western music  more recently the horn section of antibalas have been guest musicians on tv on the radios highly acclaimed 2008 album dear science as well as on british band foals 2008 album antidotes some afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of vampire weekend and paul simon there are several active afrobeat bands worldwide

tr the phrase is often used in a less serious manner in relation to someone or something that is out of control and causing trouble eg a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be said to be running amok  such usage does not imply murderous actions and any emotional implications eg rage fear excitement must be gleaned from context the word was used by the british to describe to runamuck or murder indiscriminately it was later used in india during the british empire to describe an elephant gone mad separated from its herd running wild and causing devastation the word was made popular by the colonial tales of rudyard kipling although commonly used in a colloquial and lessviolent sense the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic culturebound syndrome in malaysian culture  in a typical case of running amok a male who has shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence will acquire a weapon and in a sudden frenzy will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters  amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing suicide during the american occupation of the philippines many noted incidences of individuals running amok in mindanao palawan and sulu were documented in photographs  during the spanish colonial period the amuks were called juramentador meaning those who have taken a vow as the amok was confused with the tradition of shahid who ceremoniously took a vow to god detailing that he would die whilst attacking the enemy in the hopes of attaining jannah this vow was usually taken in front of a rajah and an imam before attacking the same typical malay method of spontaneous suicide attack with the kalis was used by syahid yet a syahid would only attack enemy combatants while an amok would strike out indiscriminately at civilians the term juramentado is still synonymous with amok for christian filipinos a widely accepted explanation links  amok  with  male honor amok by women is virtually unknown running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world since perpetrators were normally killed and reestablishing ones reputation as a man to be feared and respected some observers have related this explanation to islams ban on suicide which it is suggested drove malay men to create circumstances in which others would kill them police describe such an event as a killing spree if the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often suicide by cop amok is often described as a culturebound or culturespecific syndrome which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors   other reported culturebound syndromes are latah and koro   amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of dissociative disorders crosscultural variant early travellers in asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok in which soldiers facing apparently inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death   this form of amok appears to resemble the berserker of the norse the cafard or cathard polynesia mal de pelea puerto rico and iichaa navaho in contemporary indonesia the term amok amuk generally refers not to individual violence but to apparently frenzied violence by mobs   indonesians now commonly use the term gelap mata literally darkened eyes to refer to individual amok norse berserkers and the zulu battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy the 1911 webster encyclopedia comments', 'britneyspears in 2001 she released her

revival of teen pop in the late 1990s the daily yomiuri reported that music critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years but spears has set her sights a little highershe is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by madonna and janet jackson rolling stone wrote  britney spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock  roll teen queen the dungaree doll the angel baby who just has to make a scene  rami yacoub who coproduced spearss debut album with lyricist max martin commented i know from denniz pop and maxs previous productions when we do songs theres kind of a nasal thing  with n sync and the backstreet boys we had to push for that midnasal voice  when britney did that she got this kind of raspy sexy voice  following the release of her debut album chuck taylor of billboard observed spears has become a consummate performer with snappy dance moves a clearly realalbeit youngand funkdified voice you drive me crazy her third single demonstrates spearss own development proving that the 17yearold is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice  stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic referred to her music as a blend of infectious rapinflected dancepop and smooth balladry  spears later commented with baby one more time i didnt get to show my voice off the songs were great but they werent very challenging spears possesses the vocal range of a contralto  her vocal ability has also been criticized often drawing unfavorable comparison to her pop rival christina aguilera like other danceoriented pop stars it has been widely reported that spears lipsyncs in concert  author gary giddins wrote in his book natural selection  gary giddins on comedy film music and books 2006 that among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are britney spears luciano pavarotti shania twain beyonc and madonna rashod d ollison of the baltimore sun observes  many pop stars feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement  since the advent of mtv and other video music channels pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jawdropping effects awesome choreography fabulous clothes marvelous bodies  and the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage  so if britney spears janet jackson or madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track fans wont pay up to 300 for a concert ticket  giddins adds it was reported britney spears fans prefer her to lipsyncdespite her denials of doing so contradicted by her own directorbecause they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert  noting on the prevalence of lipsyncing los angeles daily news reported in the context of a britney spears concert does it really matter  like a vegas revue show you dont go to hear the music you go for the somewhatridiculous spectacle of it all  similarly aline mendelsohn of the orlando sentinel remarked  lets get one thing straight  a britney spears concert is not about the music you have to remember that its about the sight not the sound  critic glenn gamboa comments her concert tours are like her lifea massive moneymaking venture designed to play up her talents and distract from her shortcomings with a mix of technotinged sex appeal and discoflavored flash  and like her life it is more or less a success throughout her career spears has drawn frequent comparisons to madonna and janet jackson in terms of vocals choreography and stage presence citing both as influences in her work she has also named michael jackson as a source of inspiration  according to spears i know when i was younger i looked up to people like you know janet jackson and madonna and they were major inspirations for me but i also had my own identity and i knew who i was you know  in the 2002 book madonnastyle by carol clerk she is quoted saying  i have been a huge fan of madonna since i was a little girl  shes the person that ive really looked up to i would really really like to be a legend like madonna many critics have argued that spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as jackson or madonna journalists erika montalvo and jackie sheppard of the rocky mountain collegian observed some may argue that spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon  joan anderman of the boston globe remarked that thirteen costume changes in 90 minutes wont bless her with madonnas intelligence or cultural barometer an army of cuttingedge rb producers wont supply her with janet jacksons sense of humor or sincere smile  britneys heroes arent great singers but theyre real singers  spears sounds robotic nearly inhuman on her records so processed is her voice by digital pitchshifters and synthesizers reporter ed bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album britney takes its cues from two other successful performersmadonna and janet jacksonboth of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom like spears are passable singers at best  critic shane harrison wrote  from the minimalist thump and nasty feel of im a slave 4 u to the scattered quotes in boys britney feels like spearss attempt at control madonnas respect for spears has also been a subject of observation  santiago fouzhernndez and freya jarmanivens authors of madonnas drowned worlds new approaches to her cultural transformations 19832003 2004 note that the most well known crossgenerational relationship exists between spears and madonna in which the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration the biographers also report some observers of popular culture however feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize madonnas unique contribution  madonna was never just another pop star whereas britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act spears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career  rolling stone magazine wrote  one of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century she spearheaded the rise of postmillennial teen pop  spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank she is listed by the guinness world records as having the bestselling album by a teenage solo artist for her debut album baby one more time which sold over thirteen million copies in the united states melissa ruggieri of the richmond timesdispatch reported shes also marked for being the bestselling teenage artist  before she turned 20 in 2001 spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide barbara ellen of the observer has reported  spears is famously one of the oldest teenagers pop has ever produced almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination  many 19yearolds havent even started working by that age whereas britney a former mouseketeer was that most unusual and volatile of american phenomena  a child with a fulltime career  while other little girls were putting posters on their walls britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall  whereas other children develop at their own pace britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive american entertainment industry  britney spears has been yahoos most popular search term for the last four consecutive years seven times in total  spears was named as most searched person in the guinness world records book edition 2007 and 2009 spears has also become a major influence among many new artists including kristinia debarge lady gaga little boots selena gomez  the scene pixie lott  and miley cyrus who has cited spears as one of her biggest inspirations and has also referenced spears in her hit song party in the usa bebo norman wrote a song about spears

richard cheese called britney spears a remarkable recording artist and also went on to say that she was versatile and what the industry calls an artist  people magazine and mtv reported that october 1 2008 the bronxs john philip sousa middle school named their music studio in honor of britney spears spears herself was present during the ceremony and donated 10000 to the schools music program', 'cuesports historically the umbrella term was billiards  while that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games the words usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world  for example in british and australian english billiards usually refers exclusively to the game of english billiards while in american and canadian english it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games or to all cue games in general depending upon dialect and context there are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports more obscurely there are games that make use of obstacles and targets and tabletop games played with disks instead of balls billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century to the wrapping of the body of mary queen of scots in her billiard table cover in 1586 through its many mentions in the works of shakespeare including the famous line lets to billiards in antony and cleopatra 160607 and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport including mozart louis xiv of france marie antoinette immanuel kant napoleon abraham lincoln mark twain george washington french president jules grvy charles dickens george armstrong custer theodore roosevelt lewis carroll wcfields babe ruth bob hope jackie gleason and many others all cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stickandball lawn games retroactively termed ground billiards and as such to be related to trucco croquet and golf and more distantly to the stickless bocce and balls the first known mention of a form of the word billiards appears in edmund spensers mother hubberds tale in 1591 where he speaks of all thriftles games that may be found with dice with cards with balliards the word billiard may have evolved from the french word billart or billette meaning stick in reference to the  an implement similar to a golf club which was the forerunner to the modern cue the terms origin may have also been from french bille meaning ball a recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s and was reminiscent of croquet  king louis xi of france 14611483 had the first known indoor billiard table by 1670 the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well the cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800 initially the mace was used to push the balls rather than strike them the newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge  cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound in order to enhance the appeal of the game  after a transitional period where only the better players would use cues the cue came to be the first choice of equipment the demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in europe by john thurston and other furniture makers of the era the early balls were made from wood and clay but the rich preferred to use ivory early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment including the arch related to the croquet hoop port a different hoop and king a pin or skittle near the arch in the 1770s but other game variants relying on the cushions and eventually on pockets cut into them were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards the early croquetlike games eventually led to the development of the carom or carambole billiards category  what most nonus and nonuk speakers mean by the word billiards  these games which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations are games played with three or sometimes four balls on a table without holes and without obstructions or targets in most cases in which the goal is generally to strike one  with a  then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball  variations include threecushion straight rail and the balkline variants cushion caroms fivepins and fourball among others over time a type of obstacle returned originally as a hazard and later as a target in the form of pockets or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions leading to the rise of pocket billiards especially pool games popular around the world in forms such as eightball nineball straight pool and onepocket amongst numerous others the terms pool and pocket billiards are now virtually interchangeable especially in the us english billiards what uk speakers almost invariably mean by the word billiards is a hybrid carompocket game and as such is likely fairly close to the ancestral original pocket billiards outgrowth from 18th to early 19th century carom games at least the games with regulated international professional competition have been referred to as sports or sporting events not simply games since 1893 at the latest  quite a variety of particular games ie sets of rules and equipment are the subject of presentday competition including many of those already mentioned with competition being especially broad in nineball snooker threecushion and eightball snooker though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of english billiards is a professional sport organized at the international level and its rules bear little resemblance to those of pool games a billiards category encompassing pool snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 world games held in duisburg germany and the 2006 asian games also saw the introduction of a cue sports category billiard balls vary from game to game in size design and quantity  carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls and come as a set of two cue balls one colored or marked and an object ball or two object balls in the case of the game fourball  americanstyle pool balls used in any pool game and found throughout the world come in sets of two  of object balls seven  and seven  an  and a  the balls are racked differently for different games some of which do not use the entire ball set  blackball englishstyle eightball sets are similar but have unmarked  of  or and  balls instead of solids and stripes and are smaller than the americanstyle they are used principally in britain ireland and some commonwealth countries though not exclusively since they are unsuited for playing nineball  snooker balls are also smaller than americanstyle pool balls and come in sets of 22 15 reds 6  and a cue ball  other games also have custom ball sets such as russian pyramid and bumper pool billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game including clay bakelite celluloid crystallite ivory plastic steel and wood the dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory the search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters it was in part spurred on by a new york billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of 10000 for a substitute material the first viable substitute was celluloid invented by john wesley hyatt in 1868 but the material was volatile sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable there are many sizes and styles of pool and billiard tables  generally tables are rectangles twice as long as they are wide  most pool tables are known as 7 8 or 9footers referring to the length of the tables long side  fullsize snooker and english billiard tables are convert12 long on the longest side  pool halls tend to have convert9 tables and cater to the serious pool player  pubs will typically use convert7 tables which are often coinoperated  formerly convert10 tables were common but such tables are now considered antique collectors items a few usually from the late 19th century can be found in pool halls from time to time  tenfoot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games the slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface the length of the pool table will typically be a function of space with many homeowners purchasing an convert8 table as a compromise  high quality tables are mostly 45 by convert9 interior dimensions with a bed made of three pieces of thick slate to prevent warping and changes due to humidity  smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate  pocket billiards tables normally have six pockets three on each side four corner pockets and two side pockets all types of tables are covered with billiard cloth often called felt but actually a woven wool or woolnylon blend called baize  cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century  in fact the predecessor company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth iwan simonis was formed in 1453 bar or tavern tables which get a lot of play use slower more durable cloth the cloth used in upscale pool and snooker halls and home billiard rooms is faster ie provides less friction allowing the balls to roll farther across the table and competitionquality pool cloth is made from 100 worsted wool  snooker cloth traditionally has a nap consistent fiber directionality and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap the cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green reflecting its origin originally the grass of ancestral lawn games and has been so colored since the 16th century but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue the cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game most likely because of the reflection of the games origin the players were stubborn in the fact that the cloth should not be ripped they even made women continue to use maces after cues were invented for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues a rack is the name given to a frame usually wood plastic or aluminum used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game  this is traditionally triangular in shape but varies with the type of billiards played  there are two main types of racks the more common triangular shape which is used for eightball and straight pool and the diamond shaped rack used for nineball billiards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue a cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin  high quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker the  end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a players hand the  of the cue is of smaller circumference usually tapering to an convert04 terminus called a  usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues where a rounded leather  is affixed flush with the ferrule to make final contact with balls the tip in conjunction with chalk can be used to impart spin to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center cheap cues are generally made of pine lowgrade maple and formerly often of ramin which is now endangered or other lowquality wood with inferior plastic ferrules a quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns  many modern cues are also made like golf clubs with hightech materials such as woven graphite  skilled players may use more than one cue during a game including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick and another shorter cue with a special tip for commonly in snooker they are available in three forms depending on how the player is hampered the standard rest has a simple cross the spider has a raised arch around 12cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots the giraffe or swan in england which has a raised arch much like the spider but with a slender arm reaching out around 15cm with the groove cue tip chalk invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro william a spinks and chemist william hoskins in 1897 is made by crushing silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite into a powder there are two main varieties of billiard games carom and pocket the main carom billiards games are straight billiards balkline and three cushion billiards  all are played on a pocketless table with three balls two cue balls and one object ball  in all players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponents cue ball as well as the object ball the most popular of the large variety of pocket games are eightball nineball onepocket bank pool snooker and among the old guard straight pool  in eightball and nineball the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning eponymous  wellknown but waning in popularity is straight pool in which players seek to continue sinking balls rack after rack if they can to reach a predetermined winning score typically 150  related to nineball another wellknown game is rotation where the lowestnumbered object ball on the table must be struck first although any object ball may be pocketed ie combination shot  each pocketed ball is worth its number and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner  since there are only 120 points available 12315120 scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up  in both onepocket and bank pool the players must sink a set number of balls respectively all in a particular  or all by  in snooker players score points by alternately potting  and various special in straight rail a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls although a difficult and subtle game some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to  the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of  to score a seemingly limitless number of points the first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where jacob schaefer sr scored 690 points in a single turn in light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots a  not to be confused with  which pertains to the game of english billiards is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table  in the games of balkline  181 and 182 pronounced eighteenpointtwo balkline among other more obscure variations  the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at convert18 from each rail after one or two points have been scored respectively a more elegant solution was threecushion billiards which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table and contact three rail cushions in the process  this is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn dating to approximately 1800 english billiards is a hybrid of carom and pocket billiards played on a convert6 by convert12 table  like most carom games it requires two  and a red the object of the game is to score either a fixed number

india during the 19th century the name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies to  the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited in the united kingdom snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level it is played in many other countries as well  snooker is far rarer in the us where pool games such as eightball and nineball dominate the first international snooker championship was held in 1927 and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions the world professional billiards and snooker association wpbsa was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game while the international billiards and snooker federation ibsf regulates the amateur games nineball uses only the 1 through 9 balls and cue ball it is a rotation game  the player at the table must make legal contact with the lowest numbered ball on the table or a foul is called the game is won by legally pocketing the nine ball  nineball is the predominant professional game though as of 20062008 there have been some suggestions that this may change in favor of tenballdatefebruary 2008 there are many local and regional tours and tournaments that are contested with nineball the world poolbilliard association wpa and it american affiliate the billiard congress of america bca publish the world standardized

against each other in oneonone and  nineball matches over a period of several days the mosconi cup games are played under the more stringent european rules as of 2007 a variant using only three balls generally played such that the player at turn continues shooting until all the balls are pocketed and the player to do so in the fewest shots wins the game can be played by two or more players  dispenses with some fouls common to both nine and eightball onepocket is a strategic game for two players  each player is assigned one of the corner pockets on the table  this is the only pocket into which he can legally pocket balls the first player to pocket the majority of the balls 8 in his pocket wins the game the game requires far more defensive strategy than offensive strategy much unlike eightball nineball or straight pool it has been saiddatejune 2008 that if eightball is checkers onepocket is chess  this statement can be verified by watching a game of one pocket  most times accomplished players choose to position balls near their pocket instead of trying to actually pocket them  this allows them to control the game by forcing their opponent to be on defense instead of taking a low percentage shot that could result in a loss of game  these low percentage shots are known as flyers by one pocket aficionados bank pool has been gaining popularity in recent years  bank pool can be played with a full rack can be a long game but is more typically played with nine balls frequently called nineball bank the balls are racked in nineball formation but in no particular order the object of the game is simple to be the first player to bank five balls in any order eight balls when played with a full rack  penalties and fouls are similar to one pocket in that the player committing the foul must spot a ball for each foul  this must be done before the incoming player shoots speed pool is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocket in as little time as possible  rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament the international speed pool challenge has been held annually since 2006', 'armedforcesofbosniaandherzegovina binas small arms ammunition

'barium barium has few industrial uses but the metal has been historically used to scavenge air in vacuum tubes  barium compounds impart a green color to flames and have been used in fireworks  barium sulfate is used for its density insolubility and xray opacity it is used as an insoluble heavy mudlike paste when drilling oil wells and in purer form as an xray radiocontrast agent for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract  soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium ion and have been used as rodenticides  new uses for barium continue to be sought   for example it is a component of some high temperature ybco superconductors barium is a soft and ductile metal  its simple compounds are notable for their relatively high for an alkaline earth element specific gravity  this is true of the most common bariumbearing mineral its sulfate barite baso4 also called heavy spar due to the high density 45 gcm barium is a highly reducing metal it reacts exothermically with oxygen at room temperature to form barium oxide and peroxide the reaction is violent if barium is powdered it also reacts violently with dilute acids alcohol and water barium combines with several metals including aluminium zinc lead and tin forming intermetallic compounds and alloys naturally occurring barium is a mix of seven stable isotopes the most abundant being 138ba 717  there are twentytwo isotopes known but most of these are highly radioactive and have halflives in the several millisecond to several day range the only notable exceptions are 133ba which has a halflife of 1051 years and 137mba 255 minutes 133ba is a standard calibrant for gammaray detectors in nuclear physics studies the abundance of barium is 00425  in the earths crust and 13gl in sea water it occurs in the minerals barite as the sulfate and witherite as the carbonate in northern england for example in the settlingstones mine near newbrough today nearly all barium is mined as barite a rare gem containing barium is known called benitoite  large deposits of barite are found in china germany india morocco and in the us because barium quickly oxidizes in air it is difficult to obtain the free metal and it is never found free in nature the metal is primarily found in and extracted from barite  because barite is so insoluble it cannot be used directly for the preparation of other barium compounds or barium metal  instead the ore is heated with carbon to reduce it to barium sulfide the barium sulfide is then hydrolyzed or treated with acids to form other barium compounds such as the chloride nitrate and carbonate barium is commercially produced through the electrolysis of molten barium chloride bacl2 barium metal is also obtained by the reduction of barium oxide with finely divided aluminium at temperatures between 1100 and 1200 c the barium vapor is cooled and condensed to give the solid metal which can be cast into rods or extruded into wires  being a flammable solid it is packaged under argon in steel containers or plastic bags ba2 is the dominant oxidation state throughout the chemistry of barium   its properties generally resemble those of other alkaline earth ions such as strontium and calcium   all halides pseudohalides and chalcogenides are known usually as colourless solids the sulfate is famously insoluble   bao forms a peroxide when heated in air the oxide is basic and reacts with acids to give salts barium reduces oxides chlorides and sulfides of less active metals  for example at elevated temperatures barium combines with nitrogen and hydrogen to produce the nitride ba3n2 and hydride bah2 respectively  when heated with nitrogen and carbon it forms the cyanide bariums name originates from greek  barys meaning heavy describing the density of some common bariumcontaining ores  alchemists in the early middle ages knew about some barium minerals  smooth pebblelike stones of mineral barite found in bologna italy were known as bologna stones the fact that after exposed to light they would glow for years attracted witches and alchemists to them carl scheele identified barite as containing a new element in 1774 but could not isolate barium  oxidized barium was at first called barote by guyton de morveau a name which was changed by antoine lavoisier to baryta  barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by sir humphry davy in england davy by analogy with calcium named barium after baryta with the ium ending signifying a metallic element the production of pure oxygen in the brin process was a large scale application of barium peroxide before electrolysis and fractionally distill liquefied air became the dominant ways to produce oxygen  in this process the barium oxide reacts at 500600c with air to form barium peroxide which decomposes at above 700c by releasing oxygen the dominating application of elemental barium is as a scavenger or getter removing the last traces of oxygen and other gases in electronic vacuum tubes such as television cathode ray tubes an alloy of barium with nickel is used in spark plug wire barium sulfate the mineral barite baso4 is important to the petroleum industry eg as drilling mud a weighting agent in drilling new oil wells aside from the sulfate other compounds of barium find only niche applications   applications are limited by the toxicity of ba2 ions barium carbonate is a rat poison which is not a problem for the insoluble baso4 soluble barium compounds are poisonous  at low doses barium acts as a muscle stimulant whereas higher doses affect the nervous system causing cardiac irregularities tremors weakness anxiety dyspnea and paralysis  this may be due to its ability to block potassium ion channels which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system  however individual responses to barium salts vary widely with some being able to handle barium nitrate casually without problems and others becoming ill from working with it in small quantities  barium acetate was used by marie robards to poison her father in texas in 1993  she was tried and convicted in 1996 because it is highly insoluble in water as well as stomach acids barium sulfate can be taken orally it is eliminated completely from the digestive tract  unlike other heavy metals barium does not bioaccumulate  however inhaled dust containing barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs causing a benign condition called baritosis', 'beowulf it survives in a single manuscript known as the nowell codex its composition by an anonymous anglosaxon poet is dated between the 8th and the early 11th century in the poem beowulf a hero of the geats battles three antagonists  grendel who has been attacking the resident warriors of the mead hall of hrogar the king of the danes grendels mother and an unnamed dragon  after the first two victories beowulf goes home to geatland in sweden and becomes king of the geats the last fight takes place fifty years later  in this final battle beowulf is fatally wounded  after his death his servants bury him in a tumulus in geatland the events described in the poem take place in the late 5th century after the anglosaxons had begun migration and settlement in england and before the beginning of the 7th century a time when the saxons were either newly arrived or in close contact with their fellow germanic kinsmen in scandinavia and northern germany the poem could have been transmitted in england by people of geatish origins it has been suggested that beowulf was first composed in the 7th century at rendlesham in east anglia as sutton hoo also shows close connections with scandinavia and also that the east anglian royal dynasty the wuffings were descendants of the geatish wulfings others have associated this poem with the court of king alfred or with the court of king canute the poem deals with legends ie it was composed for entertainment and does not separate between fictional elements and real historic events such as the raid by king hygelac into frisia ca 516  scholars generally agree that many of the personalities of beowulf also appear in scandinavian sources specific works designated in the following section  this does not only concern people eg healfdene hrogar halga hroulf eadgils and ohthere but also clans eg scyldings scylfings and wulfings and some of the events eg the battle on the ice of lake vnern as far as sweden is concerned the dating of the events in the poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the barrows indicated by snorri sturluson and by swedish tradition as the graves of ohthere dated to c 530 and his son eadgils dated to c 575 in uppland sweden in denmark recent archaeological excavations at lejre where scandinavian tradition located the seat of the scyldings ie heorot have revealed that a hall was built in the mid6th century exactly the time period of beowulf three halls each about 50 metres long were found during the excavation the majority view appears to be that people such as king hrogar and the scyldings in beowulf are based on real people in 6thcentury scandinavia like the finnsburg fragment and several shorter surviving poems beowulf has consequently been used as a source of information about scandinavian personalities such as eadgils and hygelac and about continental germanic personalities such as offa king of the continental angles as with other matters concerning provenance ie date of composition author geographic origin etc identified sources and analogues for beowulf cannot be proven and are merely researched theories  both of these are very important in regards to the mystery surrounding the beowulf manuscript as the works from which it draws from or influences suggest timeframes of composition geographic boundaries from which it could be composed or range both spatial and temporal of influence ie when it was popular and where its popularity took it  there are five main categories in which potential sources andor analogues are included  scandinavian parallels classical sources irish sources and analogues ecclesiastical sources and echoes in other old english texts early studies into scandinavian sourcesanalogues proposed that beowulf was a translation of an original scandinavian work but this idea was soon abolished  in 1878 gubrandur vigfsson made the connection between beowulf and the grettis saga of which the latter is considered to be an analogue to the former  this is currently one of the only scandinavian analogues to receive a general consensus of potential connection there are a few other important though generally less accepted theories on a scandinavian analogue  tales concerning the skjldungs possibly originating as early as the 6th century were later used as a narrative basis in such texts as gesta danorum by saxo grammaticus and hrlfs saga kraka some scholars see beowulf as a product of these early tales along with gesta danorum and hrlfs saga kraka  paul beekman taylor used the ynglingasaga as proof that the beowulf poet was likewise working from germanic tradition friedrich panzer attempted to contextualize beowulf and other scandinavian works including grettis saga under the international folktale type 301b or the bears son tale  however although this approachthe shift from the quasihistorical or legendary materials to the folktale line of inquirywas seen as a step in the right direction the bears son tale was seen as too universal  in a term coined by peter jrgensen the twotroll tradition a more concise frame of reference was found the twotroll tradition refers to a norse ecotype in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants usually of different sexes  both grettis saga and beowulf fit this folktale type generally speaking scholars who favored irish parallels directly spoke out against proscandinavian theories citing them as unjustified  wilhelm grimm is noted to be the first person to ever link beowulf with irish lore  however it was just a slight mention  max deutschbein is noted as the first person to ever present the argument in academic form he suggested the irish feast of bricriu as a source for beowulfa theory that was soon denied potentiality by oscar olson swedish folklorist carl wilhelm von sydow argued against both scandinavian translation and source material due to his theory that beowulf is fundamentally christian and written at a time when any norse tale would have most likely been pagan in nature in the late 1920s heinzer dehmer suggested beowulf as contextually based in the folktale type  the hand and the child due to the motif of the monstrous arma motif that distances grettis saga and beowulf and further aligns beowulf with irish parallelism  james carney and martin puhvel also agree with this hand and the child contextualization  carney also ties beowulf to irish through the tin b frech story  puhvel supported the hand and the child theory through such motifs as the more powerful giant mother the mysterious light in the cave the melting of the sword in blood the phenomenon of battle rage swimming prowess combat with water monsters underwater adventures and the bearhug style of wrestling  attempts to find classical or late latin influence or analogue in beowulf are almost exclusively linked with homers odyssey or virgils aeneid in 1926 albert s cook suggested a homeric connection due to equivalent formulas metonymies and analogous voyages james a works essay odyssean influence on the beowulf also supported the homeric influence he stated that encounter between beowulf and unferth was parallel to the encounter between odysseus and euryalus in books 78 of the odyssey this theory of homers influence on beowulf remained very prevalent in the 1920s but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely comparative literature  friedrich klaeber somewhat led the attempt to connect beowulf and virgil near the start of the 20th century claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a germanic world is contingent on virgil similarly in 1971 alistair campbell stated that the apologue technique used in beowulf is so infrequent in the epic tradition aside from when virgil uses it that the poet who composed beowulf couldnt have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across virgils writings whether seen as a pagan work with christian coloring added by scribes or as a christian historical novel with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as local color as margaret e goldsmith did in the christian theme of beowulf  it cannot be denied that christianity pervades the text and with that the use of the bible as a source  beowulf channels genesis exodus and daniel  the bible can fall into both the category of ecclesiastical sources and also this category as the beowulf poet would have relied on old english translations the main protagonist beowulf a hero of the geats comes to the aid of hrothgar the king of the danes whose great hall heorot is plagued by the monster grendel beowulf kills both grendel and grendels mother the latter with a magical sword later in his life beowulf is himself king of the geats and finds his realm terrorized by a dragon whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound he attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns but they do not succeed  beowulf decides to follow the dragon into its lair at earnans but only his young swedish relative wiglaf dares join him  beowulf finally slays the dragon but is mortally wounded he is buried in a tumulus by the sea beowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts the poem also begins in medias res into the middle of affairs or simply in the middle which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity  although the poem begins with beowulfs arrival grendels attacks have been going on for some time the poet who composed beowulf while objective in telling the tale nonetheless utilizes a certain style to maintain excitement and adventure within the story an elaborate history of characters and their lineages are spoken of as well as their interactions with each other debts owed and repaid and deeds of valor jane chance professor of english rice university in her 1980 article the structural unity of beowulf the problem of grendels mother argued that there are two standard interpretations of the poem one view which suggests a twopart structure ie the poem is divided between beowulfs battles with grendel and with the dragon and the other a threepart structure this interpretation argues that beowulfs battle with grendels mother is structurally separate from his battle with grendel chance stated that this view of the structure as twopart has generally prevailed since its inception in jrr tolkiens beowulf the monsters and the critics in proceedings of the british academy 22 1936 beowulf a young warrior from geatland hears of hrogars troubles and with his kings permission leaves his homeland to help hrogar beowulf and his men spend the night in heorot after they fall asleep grendel enters the hall and attacks devouring one of beowulfs men  beowulf who bears no weapon as this would be an unfair advantage over the unarmed beast has been feigning sleep and leaps up to clench grendels hand the two battle until it seems as though the hall might collapse  beowulfs retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid but their blades can not pierce grendels skin as he is immune to human weapons  finally beowulf tears grendels arm from his body at the shoulder and grendel runs to his home in the marshes to die the next night after celebrating grendels death hrogar and his men sleep in heorot grendels mother appears and attacks the hall she kills hrogars most trusted warrior schere in revenge for grendels death hrogar beowulf and their men track grendels mother to her lair under a lake  beowulf prepares himself for battle he is presented with a sword hrunting by a warrior called unferth after stipulating a number of conditions to hrogar in case of his death including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by unferth of beowulfs estate beowulf dives into the lake he is swiftly detected and attacked by grendels mother  however she is unable to harm beowulf through his armour and drags him to the bottom of the lake  in a cavern containing grendels body and the remains of men that the two have killed grendels mother and beowulf engage in fierce combat at first grendels mother appears to prevail  beowulf finding that hrunting cannot harm his foe discards it in fury  beowulf is again saved from his opponents attack by his armour and grasping a mighty sword of the giants from grendels mothers armoury which no other man could have hefted in battle beowulf beheads her  traveling further into the lair beowulf discovers grendels corpse and severs his head  beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the ninth hour l 1600 nn about 3pm he returns to heorot where hrogar gives beowulf many gifts including the sword ngling his familys heirloom after he is cremated beowulf is buried in geatland on a cliff overlooking the sea where sailors are able to see his tumulus the dragons treasure is buried with him in accordance with beowulfs wishes rather than distributed to his people  there is a curse associated with the hoard it is widely accepted that there are three funerals in beowulf the funerals are also paired with the three battles described above the first funeral in the poem is of scyld scefing translated in some versions as shield shiefson the king of the danes the first fitt helps the poet illustrate the settings of the poem by introducing hrothgars lineage the funeral leads to the introduction of the hero beowulf and his confrontation with the first monster grendel this passage begins by describing scylds glory as a scourge of many tribes a wrecker of meadbenches  the second funeral in the poem is that of hildeburgs kin and is the second fitt of this poem an additional argument towards viewing this passage as a funeral lies in the statement tumbling hawk and swift horse the fourth and final funeral of the poem is beowulfs funeral  after the final battle against the dragon beowulf receives fatal wounds and dies the greatness of beowulfs life is demonstrated through this funeral particularly through the many offerings of his people the earliest known owner of the beowulf manuscript is the 16thcentury scholar laurence nowell after whom the manuscript is named though its official designation is cotton vitellius axv because it was one of  robert bruce cottons holdings in the middle of the 17th century   kevin kiernan argues that nowell most likely acquired it through william cecil 1st baron burghley in 1563 when nowell entered cecils household as a tutor to his ward edward de vere 17th earl of oxford it suffered damage in the cotton library fire at ashburnham house in 1731  since then parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters  rebinding efforts though saving the manuscript from much degeneration have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem causing further loss  kevin kiernan professor of english at the university of kentucky is foremost in the computer digitization and preservation of the manuscript the electronic beowulf project using fibreoptic backlighting to further reveal lost letters of the poem the poem is known only from this single manuscript which is estimated to date from close to ad 1000    kiernan  has argued from an examination of the manuscript that it was the authors own working copy he dated the work to the reign of canute the great the owner of the codex before nowell remains a mystery reverend thomas smith and humfrey wanley undertook the task of cataloguing the cotton library in which the nowell codex was held  smiths catalogue appeared in 1696 and humfreys in 1705  the beowulf manuscript itself is mentioned in name for the first time in a letter in 1700 between george hickes wanleys assistant and wanley in the letter to wanley hickes responds to an apparent charge against smith made by wanley that smith had failed to mention the beowulf script when cataloguing cotton ms vitellius a xv hickes replies to wanley i can find nothing yet of beowulph the beowulf manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes  scribe a and scribe b the latter of whom took over at line 1939  the handwriting of the two scribes is illmatched  however for at least a century some scholars have maintained that the description of grendels mere in beowulf was borrowed from st pauls vision of hell in homily 16 of the blickling homilies   over the years beowulf scholars have put the work of the scribes under intense scrutiny many debate whether the scribes even held a copy as some believe they worked solely from oral dictation   men such as benjamin thorpe saw many errors in rhetoric and diction implying that the transcribing made little to no sense   most intriguing however becomes the abhorrence of scribe as  mechanical editing   this reveals the strength of beowulfs oral history as poetic flow were prioritized over dialect grammatical coherency icelandic scholar grmur jnsson thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815 working under a historical research commission of the danish government he made one himself and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no anglosaxon since that time the manuscript has crumbled further and the thorkelin transcripts remain a prized secondary source for beowulf scholars the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to these transcripts  their accuracy has been called into question however eg by chauncey brewster tinker in the translations of beowulf a comprehensive survey of 19thcentury translations and editions of beowulf and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in thorkelins time is unclear opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is contemporary with its transcription or whether the poem was composed at an earlier time possibly as one of the bears son tales and orally transmitted for many years and then transcribed at a later date  lord 1960 felt strongly the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance though likely taken at more than one sitting kiernan 1996 argues on the basis of paleographical and codicological evidence that the poem is contemporary with the manuscript  kiernans reasoning has in part to do with the muchdiscussed political context of the poem it has been held by most scholars until recently that the poem was composed in the 8th century on the assumption that a poem eliciting sympathy for the danes could not have been composed by anglosaxons during the viking ages of the 9th and 10th centuries kiernan argues against an 8thcentury provenance because this would still require that the poem be transmitted by anglosaxons through the viking age holds that the paleographic and codicological evidence encourages the belief that beowulf is an 11thcentury composite poem and states that scribe a and scribe b are the authors and that scribe b is the more poignant of the two the view of j r r tolkien is that the poem retains a much too genuine memory of anglosaxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the christianization of england around ad 700 a suggestion made by john mitchell kemble 1849 and defended by jching 1976 puts a terminus post quem of the early 9th century on the finnesburg episode at least  kemble identifies the character of hnaef son of hoc with the historical alamannic nobleman hnabi son of huoching d ca 788 worked into the earlier episode set in frisia around ad 800 at the earliest the 11th century date is due to scholars who argue that rather than transcription of the tale from the oral tradition by a literate monk beowulf reflects an original interpretation of the story by the poet the question of whether beowulf was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate and involves more than the mere matter of how it was composed  rather given the implications of the theory of oralformulaic composition and oral tradition the question concerns how the poem is to be understood and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate scholarly discussion about beowulf in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s the debate might be framed starkly as follows on the one hand we can hypothesize a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero the grendel episode the grendels mother story and the firedrake narrative  these fragments would be held for many years in tradition and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next the poem is composed orally and extemporaneously and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral pagan germanic heroic and tribal  on the other hand one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe who acquired literacy by way of learning latin and absorbing latinate culture and ways of thinking probably a monk and therefore profoundly christian in outlook  on this view the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaizing   there is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can it sees more than one christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem separated from each other by hundreds of years it sees the poem as originally the product of a literate christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the christian himself a convert perhaps or one whose forbears had been pagan a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary milieus and was capable of a masterful repurposing of poetry from the oral tradition this early christian poet saw virtue manifest in a willingness to sacrifice oneself in a devotion to justice and in an attempt to aid and protect those in need of help and greater safety good pagan men had trodden that noble path and so this poet presents pagan culture with equanimity and respect yet overlaid upon this early christian poets composition are verses from a much later reformist fireandbrimstone christian poet who vilifies pagan practice as dark and sinful and who adds satanic aspects to its monsters m h abrams and stephen greenblatt assert in their introduction to beowulf in the norton anthology of english literature that the poet was reviving the heroic language style and pagan world of ancient germanic oral poetry  it is now widely believed that beowulf is the work of a single poet who was a christian and that his poem reflects wellestablished christian tradition however scholars such as dk crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of oralformulaic composition which hypothesizes that epic poems were at least to some extent improvised by whoever was reciting them  in his landmark work the singer of tales albert lord refers to the work of francis p magoun and others saying the documentation is complete thorough and accurate  this exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that beowulf was composed orally examination of beowulf and other anglosaxon poetry for evidence of oralformulaic composition has met with mixed response  while themes inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event such as the arming the hero or the particularly wellstudied hero on the beach theme do exist across anglosaxon and other germanic works some scholars conclude that anglosaxon poetry is a mix of oralformulaic and literate patterns arguing that the poems both were composed on a wordbyword basis and followed larger formulae and patterns larry benson argued that the interpretation of beowulf as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyze the poem in a unified manner and with due attention to the poets creativity  instead he proposed that other pieces of germanic literature contain kernels of tradition from which beowulf borrows and expands upon a few years later ann watts published a book in which she argued against the imperfect application of traditional homeric oralformulaic theory to anglosaxon poetry she also argued that the two traditions are not comparable and should not be regarded as such  thomas gardner agreed with watts in a paper published four years later which argued that the beowulf text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from formulae and themes john miles foley held specifically with reference to the beowulf debate that while comparative work was both necessary and valid it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume or depend upon finally unverifiable assumptions about composition and that discard the oralliterate dichotomy focused on composition in favor of a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality finally in the view of ursula schaefer the question of whether the poem was oral or literate becomes something of a red herring  in this model the poem is created and is interpretable within both noetic horizons  schaefers concept of vocality offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand germanic pagan and oral and on the other latinderived christian and literate but as stated by monika ottera tertium quid a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own the poem mixes the west saxon and anglian dialects of old english though it predominantly uses west saxon as do other old english poems copied at the time there is a bewildering array of linguistic forms in the beowulf manuscript it is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas kiernans argument against an early dating based on a mixture of forms is long and involved but he concludes that the mixture of forms points to a comparatively straightforward history of the written text as according to this view beowulf can largely be seen to be the product of antiquarian interests and that it tells readers more about an 11thcentury anglosaxons notions about denmark and its prehistory than it does about the age of bede and a 7th or 8thcentury anglosaxons notions about his ancestors homeland there are in beowulf rather more than thirtyone hundred distinct words and almost thirteen hundred occur exclusively or almost exclusively in this poem and in the other poetical texts  considerably more than onethird of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use  there are in round numbers three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in beowulf and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings  one hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix gereckoning a few found only in the pastparticiple but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest anglosaxon period the nouns number sixteen hundred  seven hundred of them including those formed with prefixes of which fifty or considerably more than half have ge are simple nouns at the highest reckoning not more than onefourth is absent in prose  that this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the norman conquest an old english poem such as beowulf is very different from modern poetry  anglosaxon poets typically used alliterative verse  a form of verse that uses alliteration as the principal structuring device to unify lines of poetry as opposed to other devices such as rhyme  this is a technique in which the first half of the line the averse is linked to the second half the bverse through similarity in initial sound  in addition the two halves are divided by a caesura  oft scyld scefing    sceaena reatum l 4 the poet has a choice of epithets or formulae to use in order to fulfill the alliteration  when speaking or reading old english poetry it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced the same way as they are in modern english the letter h for example is always pronounced hrogar hrothgar and the digraph cg is pronounced like dj as in the word edge   both f and s vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment   between vowels or voiced consonants they are voiced sounding like modern v and z respectively   otherwise they are unvoiced like modern f in fat and s in sat some letters which are no longer found in modern english such as thorn  and eth  representing both pronunciations of modern english th as in cloth and clothe are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern english editions the voicing of these characters echoes that of f and s   both are voiced as in clothe between other voiced sounds  oer laleas suern   otherwise they are unvoiced as in cloth  unor su sofst kennings are also a significant technique in beowulf they are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre  for example a poet might call the sea the swanroad or the whaleroad a king might be called a ringgiver  there are many kennings in beowulf and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in old english which is heavily formulaic the poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors jrr tolkien argued that the poem is an elegy in historical terms the poems characters would have been norse pagans the historical events of the poem took place before the christianization of scandinavia yet the poem was recorded by christian anglosaxons who had largely converted from their native anglosaxon paganism around the 7th century both anglosaxon paganism and norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of germanic paganism  beowulf thus depicts a germanic warrior society in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance  m h abrams and stephen greenblatt note that this society was strongly defined in terms of kinship if someone was killed it was the duty of surviving kin to exact revenge either with their own lives or through weregild a payment of reparation stanley b greenfield professor of english university of oregon has suggested that references to the human body throughout beowulf emphasize the relative position of thanes to their lord he argues that the term shouldercompanion could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane aeschere who was very valuable to his lord hrothgar with aescheres death hrothgar turns to beowulf as his new arm   in addition greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect only appearing four times in the poem it is used in conjunction with unferth a man described by beowulf as weak traitorous and cowardly  greenfield notes that unferth is described as at the kings feet line 499  unferth is also a member of the foot troops who throughout the story do nothing and generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action  at the same time richard north professor of english university college london argues that the beowulf poet interpreted danish myths in christian form as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a christian audience and states  as yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned  this question is pressing given  that anglosaxons saw the danes as heathens rather than as foreigners  grendels mother and grendel are described as descendants of cain a fact which some scholars link to the cain tradition scholars disagree however as to the meaning and nature of the poem is it a christian work set in a germanic pagan context the question suggests that the conversion from the germanic pagan beliefs to christian ones was a very slow and gradual process over several centuries and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poems message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written  robert f yeager professor of literature university of north carolina at asheville notes the facts that form the basis for these questions that the scribes of cotton vitellius axv were christian is beyond doubt and it is equally certain that beowulf was composed in a christianized england since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries  yet the only biblical references in beowulf are to the old testament and christ is never mentioned the poem is set in pagan times and none of the characters is demonstrably christian in fact when we are told what anyone in the poem believes we learn that they are pagans  beowulfs own beliefs are not expressed explicitly he offers eloquent prayers to a higher power addressing himself to the father almighty or the wielder of all were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the christians subsequently appropriated  or did the poems author intend to see beowulf as a christian urhero symbolically refulgent with christian virtues writer e talbot donaldson seemed extremely certain in his criticism of the poem focusing on the exact age and locational elements that surrounded the poem itself he claimed that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago during the first half of the eighth century   donaldson also believes the writer to be a native of what was then west mercia located in the western midlands of england however the late tenth century manuscript which alone preserves the poem originated in the kingdom of the west saxons  as it is more commonly known   as a result of the 1731 fire that seriously damaged the manuscript donaldson claims that several lines and words have been lost from the poem   concerning language donaldson argues that  the reason as to why beowulf is difficult to connect with is due to the fact that there have been numerous transcriptions starting from the poems composition up until it was copied into manuscript form   even though there has been many debates about whether there are christian entities present within the poem donaldson is certain that the poet who put the materials into their present form was a christian andpoem reflects a christian tradition the author and merton professor of anglosaxon at oxford university jrr tolkien criticized his contemporaries own literary criticism of the poem as being confused by their interest in its historical implications he noted that as a result the poem had mostly been overlooked as a literary benchmark until his 1936 criticism beowulf the monsters and the critics suggested that the poems nature is in fact so interesting as poetry in places poetry so powerful that this quite overshadows the historical content in 1805 sharon turner translated selected verses into modern english during the early 20th century frederick klaebers httpwwwfordhameduhalsallbasisbeowulfoehtml beowulf and the fight at finnsburg which included the poem in old english an extensive glossary of old english terms and general background information became the central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their

anthology of english literature', 'bijection in mathematics a bijection or a bijective function is a function f from a set x to a set y with the property that for every y in y there is exactly one x in x such that fx  y it follows from this definition that no unmapped element exists in either x or y alternatively f is bijective if it is a onetoone correspondence between those sets ie both onetoone injective and onto surjective for example consider the function succ defined from the set of integers z to z that to each integer x associates the integer succx  x  1   for another example consider the function sumdif that to each pair xy of real numbers associates the pair sumdifxy  xy xy a bijective function from a set to itself is also called a permutation the set of all bijections from x to y is denoted as x  y sometimes this notation is reserved for binary relations and bijections are denoted by x  y instead  occasionally the set of permutations of a single set x may be denoted x bijective functions play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics for instance in the definition of isomorphism and related concepts such as homeomorphism and diffeomorphism permutation group projective map and many others a function f is bijective if and only if its inverse relation  f 1 is a function   in that case f 1 is also a bijection the composition gcirc f of two bijections fxto y and gyto z is a bijection the inverse of gcirc f is gcirc f1f1circg1 conversely if the composition gcirc f of two functions is bijective we can only say that f is injective and g is surjective a relation f from x to y is a bijective function if and only if there exists another relation g from y to x such that  gcirc f is the identity function on x and fcirc g is the identity function on y consequently the sets have the same cardinality if x and y are finite sets then there exists a bijection between the two sets x and y iff x and y have the same number of elements  indeed in axiomatic set theory this is taken as the very definition of same number of elements and generalising this definition to infinite sets leads to the concept of cardinal number a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets formally bijections are precisely the isomorphisms in the category set of sets and functions   however the bijections are not always the isomorphisms   for example in the category top of topological spaces and continuous functions the isomorphisms must be homeomorphisms in addition to being bijections', 'bigfoot a majority of scientists discount the existence of bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore misidentification and hoax rather than a legitimate animal in part because some estimate large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population a small minority of accredited researchers such as jane goodall and jeffrey meldrum have expressed interest and possible belief in the creature  with meldrum expressing the opinion that evidence collected of alleged bigfoot encounters warrants further evaluation and testing  nevertheless bigfoot remains one of the more famous and controversial examples of a cryptid within cryptozoology and an enduring legend bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy apelike creature ranging between convert6 tall weighing in excess of convert500 and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair  alleged witnesses have described large eyes a pronounced brow ridge and a large lowset forehead the top of the head has been described as rounded and crested similar to the sagittal crest of the male gorilla  bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong unpleasant smell by those who claim to have encountered it the enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as convert24 long and convert8 wide some have also contained claw marks making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears which have five toes and claws some proponents have also claimed that bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal wildmen stories are found among the indigenous population of the pacific northwest the legends existed prior to a single name for the creature they differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community  similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except antarctica members of the lummi tell tales about tsemekwes the local version of bigfoot the stories are similar to each other in terms of the general descriptions of tsemekwes but details about the creatures diet and activities differed between the stories of different families some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures the stiyaha or kwikwiyai were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a personsometimes to be killed  in 1847 paul kane reported stories by the native people about skoocooms a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of mount st helens less menacing versions such as the one recorded by reverend elkanah walker exist  in 1840 walker a protestant missionary recorded stories of giants among the native americans living in spokane washington the indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermens nets the local legends were combined together by j w burns in a series of canadian newspaper articles in the 1920s  each language had its own name for the local version many names meant something along the lines of wild man or hairy man although other names described common actions it was said to perform eg eating clams and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature reflected in these various stories  burnss articles popularized both the legend and its new name making it well known in western canada before it gained popularity in the united states in 1951 eric shipton had photographed what he described as a yeti footprint  bigfoot gained international attention when the story was picked up by the associated press following the death of ray wallace  a local logger  his family attributed the creation of the footprints to him has stated that her husband was in on the hoax with wallace as bigfoot has become better known and a phenomenon in popular culture sightings have spread throughout north america in addition to the pacific northwest the great lakes region and the southeastern united states have had many reports of bigfoot sightings about a third of all bigfoot sightings are concentrated in the pacific northwest with most of the remaining sightings spread throughout the rest of north america some bigfoot advocates such as cryptozoologist john willison green have postulated that bigfoot is a worldwide phenomenon the most notable sightings include various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature bigfoot would be if it existed the scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks  while cryptozoologists generally explain bigfoot as an unknown ape some believers in bigfoot attribute the phenomenon to ufos or other paranormal causes a minority of proponents of a natural explanation have attributed bigfoot to animals that are not apes such as the giant ground sloth the reported size of bigfoot approximates that of a bear standing on its hind legs and bears have a high prevalence in regions said to be inhabited by bigfoot as such they are likely candidates to explain some sightings in 2007 the pennsylvania game commission said that photos the bigfoot field researchers organization claimed showed a juvenile bigfoot were most likely of a bear with mange  jeffrey meldrum on the other hand said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bearlike and stated that he felt they were more like a human a tale presented in theodore roosevelts 1892 book the wilderness hunter reprinted in his  1900 book hunting the grisly and other sketches describing an encounter between two hunters and a violent bear is sometimes presented by bigfoot proponents as historical evidence of the creatures existence both bigfoot researchers and critics agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals  cryptozoologists loren coleman and diane stocking have estimated that as many as 70 to 80 percent of sightings are not real bigfoot sightings or footprints are often demonstrably hoaxes  author jerome clark argues that the jacko affair involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in british columbia was a hoax  citing research by john green who found that several contemporary british columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious clark notes that the mainland guardian of new westminster british columbia wrote absurdity is written on the face of it on july 14 2005 tom biscardi a longtime bigfoot enthusiast and ceo of searching for bigfoot inc appeared on the coast to coast am paranormal radio show and announced that he was 98 sure that his group will be able to capture a bigfoot which they have been tracking in the happy camp california area a month later biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured bigfoot and was arranging a payperview event for people to see it  biscardi appeared on coast to coast am again a few days later to announce that there was no captive bigfoot biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him and the shows audience for being gullible on july 9 2008 rick dyer and matthew whitton posted a video to youtube claiming that they had discovered the body of a deceased sasquatch in a forest in northern georgia tom biscardi was contacted to investigate   dyer and whitton received 50000 from searching for bigfoot inc as a good faith gesture the story of the mens claims was covered by many major news networks including bbc cnn abc news and fox news soon after a press conference the alleged bigfoot body arrived in a block of ice in a freezer with the searching for bigfoot team  when the contents were thawed it was discovered that the hair was not real the head was hollow and the feet were rubber  dyer and whitton subsequently admitted it was a hoax after being confronted by steve kulls executive director of squatchdetectivecom bigfoot proponents grover krantz and geoffrey bourne believe that bigfoot could be a relict population of gigantopithecus bourne contends that as most gigantopithecus fossils are found in china and as many species of animals migrated across the bering land bridge it is not unreasonable to assume that gigantopithecus might have as well the gigantopithecus hypothesis is generally considered entirely speculative   gigantopithecus fossils are not found in the americas as the only recovered fossils are of mandibles and teeth there is some uncertainty about gigantopithecuss locomotion  krantz has argued based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible that gigantopithecus blacki could have been bipedal   however the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils the mainstream view is that gigantopithecus was quadrupedal and it has been argued that gigantopithecuss enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait matt cartmill presents another problem with the gigantopithecus hypothesis  the trouble with this account is that gigantopithecus was not a hominin and maybe not even a crowngroup hominoid yet the physical evidence implies that bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long stout permanently adducted hallux  these are hominin autapomorphies not found in other mammals or other bipeds it seems unlikely that gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel bernard g campbellin wrote  that gigantopithecus is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the yeti of the himalayas and the sasquatch of the northwest american coast but the evidence for these creatures is not convincing a species of paranthropus such as paranthropus robustus with its crested skull and bipedal gait was suggested by primatologist john napier and anthropologist gordon strasenburg as a possible candidate for bigfoots identity despite the fact that fossils of paranthropus are found only in africa michael rugg of the bigfoot discovery museum presented a comparison between human gigantopithecus and meganthropus skulls reconstructions made by grover krantz in episodes 131 and 132 of the bigfoot discovery museum show he favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a bigfoot to the meganthropus fossil teeth noting the worn enamel on the occlusal surface the meganthropus fossils originated from asia the tooth was found in the pacific northwest some suggest neanderthal or homo erectus to be the creature but no remains of either species are found in the new world most of the scientific community discounts the existence of bigfoot as there is little or no evidence supporting the survival of such a large prehistoric apelike creature the evidence that does exist points more towards a hoax or delusion than to sightings of a genuine creature  in addition to the lack of evidence scientists cite the fact that bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large nonhuman primate ie temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere all recognized nonhuman apes are found in the tropics of africa and asia thus as with other proposed megafauna cryptids climate and food supply issues would make such a creatures survival in reported habitats unlikely  furthermore great apes are not found in the fossil record in the americas and no bigfoot remains have ever been found  indeed scientists insist that the breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility a few scientists have offered varying degrees of support for bigfoot study and beliefs  jeffrey meldrum characterizes the search for sasquatch as a valid scientific endeavor and says that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called gigantopithecus could turn out to be ancestors of todays commonly known bigfoot john napier asserts that the scientific communitys attitude towards bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence  anthropologist david daegling echoed this idea citing a remarkably limited amount of sasquatch data that are amenable to scientific scrutiny  field biologist george shaller has spoken in favor of greater study of bigfoot evidence while still expressing skepticism towards the possibility of its existence  other scientists who have expressed guarded interest in sasquatch reports include russell mittermeier daris swindler and esteban sarmiento jane goodall in a september 27 2002 interview on national public radios science friday expressed her ideas about the existence of bigfoot first stating im sure they exist she later went on to say chuckling well im a romantic so i always wanted them to exist and finally  you know why isnt there a body i cant answer that and maybe they dont exist but i want them to   anthropologist carleton s coon whose theories on the evolution of race in humans have been largely discredited expressed support for bigfoots existence in a posthumously published essay there are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of bigfoot sightings in the united states the oldest and largest is the bigfoot field research organization or bfro the bfro also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations  their internet website includes reports from across north america that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility',

various other names is a cutting tool used in various trades and crafts for a variety of purposes  designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use utility knives are commonly used in factories warehouses and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to open boxes packages or cut through tape or cord in british australian and new zealand english along with dutch and austrian german the tool is known as a stanley knife  this name is a genericised trademark named after stanley works a manufacturer of such knives  in israel and switzerland these knives are known as japanese knives  in brazil they are known as estiletes or cortadores olfa the latter being another genericised trademark  in portugal and canada they are also known as xacto yet another genericised trademark  in the philippines italy and egypt they are simply called cutter  in general spanish they are known as cortaplumas penknife in spain mexico and costa rica they are colloquially known as cutters  other names for the tool are box cutter or boxcutter razor blade knife carpet knife pen knife stationery knife or drywall knife such a knife generally consists of a simple and cheap holder typically flat approximately one inch 25mm wide and three to four inches 75 to 100mm long and made of either metal or plastic some use standard razor blades others specialized doubleended blades as in the illustration the user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle so that for example the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package  when the blade becomes dull it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle   other models feature a quickchange mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools as well as a flipout blade storage tray the blades for a utility knife come in both double and single ended versions and are interchangeable with many but not all of the later copies  specialized blades also exist for cutting string linoleum and other purposes another style is a snapoff utility knife that contains a long segmented blade that slides out from it  as the endmost edge becomes dull it can be broken off the remaining blade exposing the next section which is sharp and ready for use  when all the individual segments are used it is thrown away or a replacement blade is inserted  this design was introduced by japanese manufacturer olfa corporation in 1956 as the worlds first snapoff blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments fixed blade versions about the size of a pencil are used for handicrafts and model making and are best suited for cutting thin lightweight materials the specialized handle and blade allowing for cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control a style that is often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which singleedge razor blades can be inserted the sleeve slides up and down on the handle holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use the blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fiberboard to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes although such knives are not usually regarded as weapons it has been suggested by united states government officials that boxcutter knives were used in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against the united states the exact design of the knives actually used is unclear  see airport security repercussions due to the september 11 attacks for

reduced in a barter exchange modern trade and barter has developed into a sophisticated tool that can sometimes help businesses increase their efficiencies by monetizing their unused capacities and excess inventories the worldwide organized barter exchange and trade industry has grown to an 8 billion a year industry and is used by thousands of businesses and individuals the advent of the internet and sophisticated relational database software programs has made it easier to conduct these activities and has further advanced the barter industrys growth  organized barter has grown globally to the point where virtually every country now has a formalized barter and trade network of some kind  complex business models based on the concept of barter are today possible since the advent of web 20 technologies  bartering benefits companies and countries that see a mutual benefit in exchanging goods and services rather than cash and it also enables those who are lacking hard currency to obtain goods and services  to make up for a lack of hard currency thailands township amphoe kut chum once issued its own local scrip called bia kut chum  bia is thai for cowry shell was once 6400 baht and is still current in metaphorical expressions  running afoul of national currency laws the community changed to barter coupons called boon kut chum that bear a fixed value in baht which they swap for goods and services within the community a trade or barter exchange is a commercial organization that provides a trading platform and bookkeeping system for its members or clients the member companies buy and sell products and services to each other using an internal currency known as barter or trade dollars  modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales conserving cash moving inventory and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world  businesses in a barter earn trade credits instead of cash that are deposited into their account they then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits  they are not obligated to purchase from who they sold to and viceversa the exchange plays an important role because they provide the recordkeeping brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member  commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side all on the sell side or a combination of both  transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15 it is estimated that over 350000 businesses in the united states are involved in barter exchange activities  there are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world  there are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange  several major cities in the us and canada do not currently have a local barter exchange  there are two industry groups the httpwwwnateorg national association of trade exchanges nate and the httpwwwirtacom international reciprocal trade association irta both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members  moreover each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade  nates currency is the known as the banc and irtas currency is called universal currency uc the first exchange system was the swiss wir bank it was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929  wir is both an abbreviation of wirtschaftsring and the word for we in german reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community corporate barter focuses on larger transactions which is different from a traditional retail oriented barter exchange   corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions it entails the use of a currency unit called a tradecredit the tradecredit must not only be known and guaranteed but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the client bought it themselves contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk swapping is the increasingly prevalent informal bartering system in which participants in internet communities trade items of comparable value on a trust basis using the internet the most notable disadvantage to electronic barter is inherent in internet commerce that of trust  how can consumers have confidence that they will receive what they bargained or paid for  although the internet based consumer market has by its continued existence and growth demonstrated that it works there is never a guarantee of satisfaction in consumer to consumer transactions  there is no absolute defense against fraud  however it can be argued that when a person barters there is less incentive to deliberately mislead  neither party is paid each party receives something that would only then have to be converted to cash  in spain particularly the catalonia region there is a growing number of exchange markets  these barter markets or swap meets work without money  participants bring things they do not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of another participant  swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed according to the international reciprocal trade association the industry trade body more than 400000 businesses transacted 10 billion globally in 2008  and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15 in 2009 barter compliments the environmental movement that has gained traction in the late 20th and early 21st centuries the expenditure of resources involved in the manufacture and distribution of new products is concomitantly reduced by trading existing products a global market for barter mitigates waste and acts as a counterpoint to the disposable economy  consumer and small business websites such as barterquestcom and swaptreasures promote bartering as a green alternative to buying and selling in the united states the sales a barter exchange makes are considered taxable revenue by the irs and the gross amount of a barter exchange members sales are reported to the irs by the barter exchange via a 1099b form the requirement for barter exchanges to report members sales was enacted in the tax equity  fair responsibility act of 1982   according to the irs the fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the income of both parties other countries do not have the reporting requirement that the us does concerning proceeds from barter transactions but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction if one barters for a profit one pays the appropriate tax if one generates a loss in the transaction they have a loss  bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense   many barter exchanges require that one register as a business need for presence of double coincidence of wants  for barter to occur between two people both would need to have what the other wants', 'bigdig the big dig is the unofficial name of the central arterytunnel project cat a  megaproject in boston that rerouted the central artery interstate 93 the chief highway through the heart of the city into a 35mile 56km tunnel the project also included the construction of the ted williams tunnel extending interstate 90 to logan international airport the leonard p zakim bunker hill memorial bridge over the charles river and the rose kennedy greenway in the space vacated by the previous i93 elevated roadway  initially the plan was also to include a rail connection between bostons two major train terminals the project concluded on december 31 2007 when the partnership between program manager bechtelparsons brinckerhoff and the massachusetts turnpike authority ended the big dig was the most expensive highway project in the us although the project was estimated in 1985 at 28 billion in 1982 dollars us60 billion adjusted for inflation over 146 billion 808 billion in 1982 dollars a july 17 2008 article in the boston globe stated in all the project will cost an additional 7 billion in interest bringing the total to a staggering 22 billion according to a globe review of hundreds of pages of state documents it will not be paid off until 2038  at the beginning of the project congressman barney frank joked wouldnt it be cheaper to raise the city than depress the artery the project has incurred criminal arrests escalating costs death leaks and charges of poor execution and use of substandard materials  former massachusetts attorney general thomas reilly demanded that contractors refund taxpayers 108 million for shoddy work  on january 23 2008 it was reported that bechtelparsons brinckerhoff the consortium that oversaw the project would pay 407 million in restitution for its poor oversight of subcontractors some of whom committed outright fraud as well as primary responsibility in the death of a motorist  however despite admitting to poor oversight and negligence as part of the settlement the firm is not barred from bidding for future government contracts  several smaller companies agreed to pay a combined sum of approximately 51 million this project was developed in response to traffic congestion on bostons historically tangled streets which were laid out long before the advent of the automobile  by mid20th century car traffic in the inner city was extremely congested especially for northsouth trips  commissioner of public works william callahan pushed through plans for an elevated expressway which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront  this central artery known officially as the john f fitzgerald expressway displaced thousands of residents and businesses and physically divided the historical connection between the downtown and market areas and the waterfront  governor john volpe interceded in the 1950s to send the last section of the central artery underground through the dewey square or south station tunnel while traffic moved somewhat better the other problems remained  there was chronic congestion on the central artery i93 an elevated sixlane highway through the center of downtown boston which was in the words of pete sigmund like a funnel full of slowlymoving or stopped cars and swearing motorists in 1959 the 15milelong 24km road section carried approximately 75000 vehicles a day but by the 1990s this had grown to 190000 vehicles a day  traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010 built before strict federal interstate highway standards were developed during the dwight d eisenhower administration the expressway was plagued by tight turns an excessive number of entrances and exits entrance ramps without merge lanes and continually escalating vehicular loads  local businesses again wanted relief historians sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city and nearby residents desired removal of the matte greenpainted elevated road which mayor thomas menino called bostons other green monster mit engineers bill reynolds and eventual state secretary of transportation frederick p salvucci envisioned moving the whole expressway underground another important motivation for the big dig in its final form was the abandonment of the massachusetts highway departments intended expressway system through and around boston the central artery as part of masshighways master plan of 1948 was originally planned to be the downtown boston stretch of interstate 95 and was signed as such a bypass road called the inner belt officially interstate 695 was to pass around the downtown core to the west through the neighborhood of roxbury and the cities of brookline cambridge and somerville however earlier controversies over impact of the boston extension of the massachusetts turnpike particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of brighton and the large number of additional homes that would have had to be destroyed led to massive community opposition to both the inner belt and the boston section of i95 clearances for i95 through the neighborhoods of roxbury jamaica plain and roslindale led to secession threats by hyde park bostons southernmost neighborhood and the neighborhood most recently added to the city in 1912  by 1972 however with only a minimum of work done on the i95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive inner belt governor francis sargent put a moratorium on highway construction within the ma128 corridor except for a short stretch of interstate 93  in 1974 the remainder of the master plan was canceled leaving boston with a severely overstressed expressway system with everincreasing traffic volumes funneled onto i93 alone the central artery became chronically gridlocked the sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of i95 away from boston around the ma128 beltway and the the original 1948 master plan included a third harbor tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right because it would have disrupted the maverick square area of east boston it was never built a major reason for the allday congestion was that the central artery carried not only northsouth traffic but much eastwest traffic as well   bostons logan airport lies across boston harbor in east boston and before the big dig the only access from downtown was through the paired callahan and sumner tunnels   traffic on the major highways from west of bostonthe massachusetts turnpike and storrow drivemostly traveled on portions of the central artery to reach these tunnels   getting between the central artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets increasing local congestion the final big dig plan then combined several projectsthe depression and improvement of the central artery the construction of a third harbor tunnel now known as the ted williams tunnel and massive interchange improvements to the massachusetts turnpike and several other major routes in the area   while only one net lane in each direction was added to the northsouth i93 several new eastwest lanes were added to untangle the traffic   eastwest traffic on the massachusetts turnpike now proceeds directly through the ted williams tunnel to logan airport and route 1a beyond with new exits in south boston along the way   traffic between storrow drive and the callahan and sumner tunnels uses a short portion of i93 but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic a number of public transportation projects were included as part of an environmental mitigation for the big dig the most expensive was the building of the phase ii silver line tunnel under fort point channel done in coordination with big dig construction  silver line buses now use this tunnel and the ted williams tunnel to link south station and logan airport yet another plan the northsouth rail link that would have connected north and south stations the major passenger train stations in boston was part of the original big dig but was ultimately dropped by the dukakis administration as an impediment to acquiring federal funding for the project the project was conceived in the 1970s by the boston transportation planning review to replace the rusting elevated sixlane central artery the expressway separated downtown from the waterfront and was increasingly choked with bumpertobumper traffic  business leaders were more concerned about access to logan airport and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel  in their second terms michael dukakis governor and fred salvucci secretary of transportation came up with the strategy of tying the two projects togetherthereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the city of boston supported planning for the big dig as a project officially began in 1982 with environmental impact studies starting in 1983  after years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the big dig was passed by us congress but it was subsequently vetoed by president ronald reagan as being too expensive  when congress overrode his veto the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991 the massachusetts turnpike authority mta which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the cat project hired a joint venture of bechtelparsons brinckerhoff to provide preliminary designs manage design consultants and construction contractors track the projects cost and schedule advise mta on project decisions and in some instances act as the mtas representative  eventually mta combined some of its employees with bechtelparsons employees in an integrated project organization  this was intended to make management more efficient but it hindered mtas ability to independently oversee bechtelparsons brinckerhoff because mta and bechtelparsons brinckerhoff had effectively become partners in the project in addition to these political and financial difficulties the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles the downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely landfill and included existing subway lines as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved  tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land the project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991 after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of rats causing them to roam the streets of boston in search of new housing  by the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994 the process had taken some seven years during which time inflation greatly increased the projects original cost estimates reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of stateoftheart construction techniques  because the old elevated highway which remained in operation throughout the construction process rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area engineers first utilized slurry wall techniques to create convert120deep concrete walls upon which the highway could rest  these concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site preventing caveins during the excavation process the multilane interstates also had to pass under south stations 7 tracks which carried over 40000 commuters and 400 trains per day  to avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced as had been initially planned a specially designed jack was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below  construction crews also used ground freezing to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel  this was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world the ground freezing enabled safer more efficient excavation and also assisted in environmental issues as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional cutandcover method had been applied other challenges included an existing subway tunnel crossing the path of the underground highway  to build slurry walls past this tunnel it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnel and build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels weight the project was managed by the massachusetts turnpike authority with the big dig and the turnpikes boston extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the metropolitan highway system design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of bechtel corporation and parsons brinckerhoff because of the enormous size of the projecttoo large for any company to undertake alonethe design and construction of the big dig were broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with welldefined interfaces between contractors  major heavyconstruction contractors on the project included jay cashman modern continental obayashi corporation perini corporation peter kiewit sons incorporated jf white and the slattery division of skanska usa of those modern continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts joint ventures included the nature of the charles river crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project  many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels but this along with 27 other plans was rejected as too costly  finally with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the tobin bridge to the charles river crossing salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as scheme z this plan was considered to be reasonably costeffective but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as 100 feet 30m immediately adjacent to the charles river the city of cambridge objected to the visual impact of the chosen charles river crossing design it sued to revoke the projects environmental certificate and forced the project to redesign the river crossing again swiss engineer christian menn took over the design of the bridge he suggested a sleek modern cablestayed bridge that would carry 10 lanes of traffic the plan was accepted and construction began on the leonard p zakim bunker hill memorial bridge the bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it the distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders it was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it is the widest cablestayed bridge in the world meanwhile construction continued on the tobin bridge approach  by the time all parties agreed on the i93 design construction of the tobin connector today known as the city square tunnel for a charlestown area it bypasses was far along significantly adding to the cost of constructing the us 1 interchange and retrofitting the tunnel boston blue clay and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local landfills fill in the granite rail quarry in quincy and restore the surface of spectacle island in the boston harbor islands national recreation area the storrow drive connector a companion bridge to the zakim began carrying traffic from i93 to storrow drive in 1999  the project had been under consideration for years but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the beacon hill neighborhood  however it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for storrow drive and downtown boston away from the mainline roadway the connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for interstate 695 enabling the mainline i93 to carry more traffic that would have used i695 under the original master plan when construction began the project cost including the charles river crossing was estimated at 58 billion  eventual cost overruns were so high that the chairman of the massachusetts turnpike authority james kerasiotes was fired in 2000  his replacement had to commit to an 855 billion cap on federal contributions  total expenses eventually passed 15 billion  interest brought this cost to 2193 billion several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them at the beginning of the project engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above  eventually they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel then cut away the elevated highways struts and lowered it onto the new braces on january 17 2003 the opening ceremony was held for the i90 connector tunnel extending the massachusetts turnpike interstate 90 east into the ted williams tunnel and onwards to logan airport the ted williams tunnel had been completed and in limited use for commercial traffic and highoccupancy vehicles since late 1995  the westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of january 18 and the eastbound lanes on january 19 the next phase moving the elevated interstate 93 underground was completed in two stages northbound lanes opened in march 2003 and southbound lanes in a temporary configuration on december 20 2003  a tunnel underneath leverett circle connecting eastbound storrow drive to i93 north and the tobin bridge opened december 19 2004 easing congestion at the circle  all southbound lanes of i93 opened to traffic on march 5 2005 including the left lane of the zakim bridge and all of the refurbished dewey square tunnel by the end of december 2004 95 of the big dig was completed  major construction remained on the surface including construction of final ramp configurations in the north end and in the south bay interchange and reconstruction of the surface streets the final ramp downtown  exit 20b from i93 south to albany street  opened january 13 2006 in 2006 the two interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the thomas tip oneill tunnel after the former democratic speaker of the house of representatives from massachusetts who pushed to have the big dig funded by the federal government many environmental impact mitigation projects transit pedestrian bicycle and parks also remain  although these were legal requirements for approval of the environmental impact statement many are not funded because of the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project   for example though the north point park was created as part of the project it ended without constructing pedestrian bridges to neighboring parks while not a legally mandated requirement public art was part of the urban design planning process and later design development work through the artery arts program the intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure retaining walls fences and lighting and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment walkways park landscape elements and bridges  as overall project costs increased the artery arts program was seen as a potential liability even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area at the beginning of the highway design process a temporary arts program was initiated and over 50 proposals were selected  however development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut  permanent public art that was funded includes super graphic text and facades of former west end houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near north station by artist sheila levrant de bretteville an historical sculpture about the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder donald mckay in east boston blue interior lighting of the zakim bridge and the millers river littoral way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the charles river extensive landscape planting as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings was requested by many community members during public meetings before the big dig the central artery carried not only northsouth traffic but much eastwest traffic a major cause of its allday congestion the only direct access to bostons logan airport from downtown was through the paired callahan and sumner tunnels under boston harbor to reach these tunnels traffic on the major highways from west of bostonthe massachusetts turnpike and storrow drivetraveled on portions of the central artery getting between the central artery and the tunnels also involved short stretches on city streets increasing local congestion and causing backups on the highway the big dig untangled this comingled traffic   while only one net lane in each direction was added to the northsouth i93 several new eastwest lanes became available   eastwest traffic on the massachusetts turnpikei90 now proceeds directly through the ted williams tunnel to logan airport and route 1a beyond   traffic between storrow drive and the callahan and sumner tunnels still uses a short portion of i93 but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic the result was a 62 reduction in vehicle hours of travel on i93 the airport tunnels and the connection from storrow drive from an average 38200 hours per day before construction 19941995 to 14800 hours per day in 20042005 after the project was largely complete the savings for travelers was estimated at 166 million annually in the same 20042005 time frame   travel times on the central artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 856 a 2008 boston globe report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of demand induced by the increased road capacity   because more drivers were opting to use the new roads traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city not reduced or eliminated although some trips are now faster the report states ultimately many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic not less the globe also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a statecommissioned study done two years ago in which the big dig was credited with helping to save at least 167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs   that study did not look at highways outside the big dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere as far back as 2001 turnpike authority officials and private contractors knew of thousands of leaks in the ceiling and wall fissures extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems and overloaded drainage systems a 10 million contract signed off as a cost overrun was used to repair these leaks  many of the leaks were a result of modern continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete  this was not made publicly known to the media but engineers at mit volunteer students and professors performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel on september 15 2004 a major leak in the interstate 93 north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted  this also forced the turnpike authority to release information regarding its nondisclosure of prior leaks a followup reported on extensive leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged the report went on to state that the 146 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks a boston globe report however countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single convert1000 section of tunnel beneath south station turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1000 to 500 massachusetts state police searched the offices of aggregate industries the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project in june 2005  they seized evidence that aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications  in may 2006 six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the united states immediately after the arrests massachusetts governor mitt romney announced he would return 3900 in political contributions from employees of aggregate industries on march 19 2006 the international herald tribune reported that massachusetts attorney general tom reilly planned to sue bechtelparsons brinckerhoff and other companies because of poor work on the project  over 200 complaints have been filed by the state of massachusetts as a result of leaks cost overruns quality concerns and safety violations in total the state is seeking approximately 100 million from the contractors 1 for every 141 spent a fatal accident raised safety questions and closed part of the project for most of the summer of 2006  on july 10 2006 a concrete ceiling panel weighing 3 tons 2722kg and measuring 20 by 40ft 61 by 122 m fell on a car traveling on the twolane ramp connecting northbound i93 to eastbound i90 in south boston killing milena del valle who was a passenger and injuring her husband angel del valle who was driving  immediately following the fatal ceiling collapse governor mitt romney ordered a stemtostern safety audit conducted by the illinois engineering firm of wiss janney elstner associates inc to look for additional areas of risk  said romney we simply cannot live in a setting where a project of this scale has the potential of threatening human life as has already been seen the collapse and closure of the tunnel greatly snarled traffic in the city the resulting traffic jams are cited as contributing to the death of another person a heart attack victim who died en route to boston medical center when his ambulance was caught in one such traffic jam two weeks after the collapse  on september 1 2006 one eastbound lane of the connector tunnel was reopened to traffic following extensive inspections and repairs interstate 90 eastand westbound lanes reopened in early january 2007  the final piece of the road network a high occupancy vehicle lane connecting interstate 93 north to the ted williams tunnel reopened on june 1 2007 on july 10 2007 after a lengthy investigation the national transportation safety board found that epoxy glue used to hold the roof in place during construction was not appropriate for longterm bonding powers fasteners the makers of the adhesive revised their product specifications on may 15 2007 to increase the safety factor from 4 to 10 for all of their epoxy products intended for use in overhead applications the safety factor on powerfast epoxy was increased from 4 to 16  in december 2008 power fasteners agreed to pay 16 million to the state to settle manslaughter charges', 'bookofjudges the book of judges hebrew sefer shoftim   is a book of the bible originally written in hebrew it appears in the tanakh and in the christian old testament its title refers to its contents it contains the history of biblical judges who helped rule and guide the ancient israelites and of their times as judges stands today the last judge it mentions is samson and although there are two further stories the traditional view is that samsons exploits probably synchronise with the period immediately preceding eli who was both high priest and judge  both academic views and traditional thought hence view the narrative of the judges as ending at samson picking up again at 1 samuel 11 to consider eli and continuing through to 1 samuel 72  as for the stories at the end of the book which are set in the same time period as the judges but discuss people other than the judges there is much affinity between these and the book of ruth and some even believe ruth originally belonged amongst them  there were thirteen biblical judges the introduction  and gives a summary of the book of joshua in some cases giving additional details the main text  discusses the six great judges and abimelech it consists of six stories each concerning a major judge and their struggles against an oppressive foreign overlord  there are also brief glosses of the rule of lesser judges often only giving their name and the numbers of their sons the appendices  give two stories set in the time of the judges but the content does not describe a particular specific judge as does the rest of the book since 1943 most scholars have accepted martin noths argument that judges together with deuteronomy joshua samuel and kings make up a single work the socalled deuteronomistic history  noth believed that this history was the work of a single author writing in babylon during the exile 586539 bce selecting editing and composing from his sources to produce a coherent work  frank moore cross later proposed that an early version of the history was composed in jerusalem in josiahs time this first version dtr1 was then revised and expanded to create noths second edition or dtr2 the overall redaction history of the present text can be summarised as follows 1 an original book of saviours made up of the stories of ehud jael and parts of gideon 2 a later enlargement which transformed the wars of the saviourjudges into wars of yahweh 3 some further additions before 4 the final revision from the deuteronomistic historians it is likely that judges draws much of its material from oral traditions especially herostories the first chapter of judges offers a glimpse of what scholars believe to be a gradual infiltration theory of israelites settling in the land of canaan the book of judges begins with a summary of the successes and mostly failures of individuals tribes to extend their control over canaan   where as other theories like the one outlined in the book of joshua book of joshua chapters 112 speak mostly to a rapid conquest theory judges 1 depicts a contrast to this  this introduction reviews the performance of the generation that outlived joshua and offers a different perspective of the conquest than that given by the book of joshua  theologian garry k brantly writes among such scholars who hold a low view of the historical reliability of the bible there are two popular theories explaining the emergence of israel in canaan the first is the peaceful infiltration model which is associated with the german scholars albrecht alt and martin noth appealing to ancient egyptian records eg the amarna letters they concluded that the israelite settlement of canaan was due to a gradual immigration into the land not a military offensive httpwwwapologeticspressorgarticles433', 'bookofjoel the book of joel is part of the hebrew bible  joel is part of a group of twelve prophetic books known as the minor prophets or simply as the twelve the distinction minor indicates the short length of the text in relation to the larger prophetic texts known as the major

211 231 314 which is applied to joels contemporary situation as well as to future blessing and judgment as there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book the main positions are evidence produced for these positions are allusions in the book to the wider world similarities with other prophets and linguistic details  other commentators such as john calvin attach no great importance to the precise dating the preservation of the book of joel indicates that it was accorded special status by its contemporaries as the word of the lord 11  its history as part of the jewish and christian canons followed that of the entire scroll of the minor prophets the masoretic text places joel between hosea and amos the order inherited by the tanakh and old testament while the septuagint order is hoseaamosmicahjoelobadiahjonah the hebrew text of joel seems to have suffered little from scribal transmission but is at a few points supplemented by the septuagint syriac and vulgate versions or by conjectural emendation while the book purports to describe a plague of locusts some ancient jewish opinion saw the locusts as allegorical interpretations of israels enemies  this allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many church fathers  calvin took a literal interpretation of ch1 but allegorical view of chapter 2 a position echoed by some modern interpreters  most modern interpreters however see joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic apocalyptic

were also ascribed to this continuator 348 could be seen as even later  details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars this splitting of the books composition began to be challenged in the midtwentieth century with scholars defending the unity of the book the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook and later additions by the prophet the authenticity of 348 has presented more challenges although a number of scholars still defend it there are many parallels of language between joel and other old testament prophets they may represent joels literary use of other prophets or vice versa in the new testament his prophecy of the outpouring of gods holy spirit upon all people was notably quoted by the apostle peter in his pentecost sermon  the table below represents some of the more explicit quotes and allusions between specific passages in joel and passages from the old and new testaments see also works on the minor prophets as a whole', 'biotechnology biotechnology draws on the pure biological sciences genetics microbiology animal cell culture molecular biology biochemistry embryology cell biology and in many instances is also dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology chemical engineering bioprocess engineering information technology biorobotics  conversely modern biological sciences including even concepts such as molecular ecology are intimately entwined and dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the life sciences industry biotechnology is not limited to medicalhealth applications unlike biomedical engineering which includes much biotechnology  although not normally thought of as biotechnology agriculture clearly fits the broad definition of using a biotechnological system to make products such that the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise  agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the neolithic revolution the processes and methods of agriculture have been refined by other mechanical and biological sciences since its inception  through early biotechnology farmers were able to select the best suited crops having the highest yields to produce enough food to support a growing population  other uses of biotechnology were required as the crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain  specific organisms and organism byproducts were used to fertilize restore nitrogen and control pests  throughout the use of agriculture farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plantsone of the first forms of biotechnology  cultures such as those in mesopotamia egypt and india developed the process of brewing beer it is still done by the same basic method of using malted grains containing enzymes to convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer  in this process the carbohydrates in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol  ancient indians also used the juices of the plant ephedra vulgaris and used to call it soma later other cultures produced the process of lactic acid fermentation which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food  fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread  although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until pasteurs work in 1857 it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form for thousands of years humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food  in selective breeding organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics  for example this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops in the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products  in 1917 chaim weizmann first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process that of manufacturing corn starch using clostridium acetobutylicum to produce acetone which the united kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during world war i biotechnology has led to the development of antibiotics  in 1928 alexander fleming discovered the mold penicillium his work led to the purification of the antibiotic by howard florey ernst boris chain and norman heatley penicillin  in 1940 penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans the field of modern biotechnology is thought to have largely begun on june 16 1980 when the united states supreme court ruled that a genetically modified microorganism could be patented in the case of diamond v chakrabarty indianborn ananda chakrabarty working for general electric had developed a bacterium derived from the pseudomonas genus capable of breaking down crude oil which he proposed to use in treating oil spills revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 129 in 2008  another factor influencing the biotechnology sectors success is improved intellectual property rights legislationand enforcementworldwide as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing and ailing us population rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector with the department of energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce us petroleumderived fuel consumption by up to 30 by 2030  the biotechnology sector has allowed the us farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeansthe main inputs into biofuelsby developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought  by boosting farm productivity biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas including health care medical crop production and agriculture non food industrial uses of crops and other products eg biodegradable plastics vegetable oil biofuels and environmental uses for example one application of biotechnology is the directed use of organisms for the manufacture of organic products examples include beer and milk products  another example is using naturally present bacteria by the mining industry in bioleaching  biotechnology is also used to recycle treat waste clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities bioremediation and also to produce biological weapons a series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology for example in medicine modern biotechnology finds promising applications in such areas as pharmacogenomics is the study of how the genetic inheritance of an individual affects hisher bodys response to drugs it is a coined word derived from the words pharmacology and genomics it is hence the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics the vision of pharmacogenomics is to be able to design and produce drugs that are adapted to each persons genetic makeup pharmacogenomics results in the following benefits most traditional pharmaceutical drugs are relatively simple molecules that have been found primarily through trial and error to treat the symptoms of a disease or illness   biopharmaceuticals are large biological molecules known as proteins and these usually target the underlying mechanisms and pathways of a malady but not always as is the case with using insulin to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus as that treatment merely addresses the symptoms of the disease not the underlying cause which is autoimmunity it is a relatively young industry they can deal with targets in humans that may not be accessible with traditional medicines a patient typically is dosed with a small molecule via a tablet while a large molecule is typically injected small molecules are manufactured by chemistry but larger molecules are created by living cells such as those found in the human body for example bacteria cells yeast cells animal or plant cells modern biotechnology is often associated with the use of genetically altered microorganisms such as e coli or yeast for the production of substances like synthetic insulin or antibiotics it can also refer to transgenic animals or transgenic plants such as bt corn  genetically altered mammalian cells such as chinese hamster ovary cho cells are also used to manufacture certain pharmaceuticals  another promising new biotechnology application is the development of plantmade pharmaceuticals biotechnology is also commonly associated with landmark breakthroughs in new medical therapies to treat hepatitis b hepatitis c cancers arthritis haemophilia bone fractures multiple sclerosis and cardiovascular disorders the biotechnology industry has also been instrumental in developing molecular diagnostic devices that can be used to define the target patient population for a given biopharmaceutical  herceptin for example was the first drug approved for use with a matching diagnostic test and is used to treat breast cancer in women whose cancer cells express the protein her2 modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply the first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases  to cite one example in 1978 genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium escherichia coli  insulin widely used for the treatment of diabetes was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals cattle andor pigs the resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost  according to a 2003 study undertaken by the international diabetes federation idf on the access to and availability of insulin in its member countries synthetic human insulin is considerably more expensive in most countries where both synthetic human and animal insulin are commercially available eg within european countries the average price of synthetic human insulin was twice as high as the price of pork insulin  yet in its position statement the idf writes that there is no overwhelming evidence to prefer one species of insulin over another and modern highly purified animal insulins remain a perfectly acceptable alternative modern biotechnology has evolved making it possible to produce more easily and relatively cheaply human growth hormone clotting factors for hemophiliacs fertility drugs erythropoietin and other drugs  most drugs today are based on about 500 molecular targets  genomic knowledge of the genes involved in diseases disease pathways and drugresponse sites are expected to lead to the discovery of thousands more new targets genetic testing involves the direct examination of the dna molecule itself a scientist scans a patients dna sample for mutated sequences there are two major types of gene tests  in the first type a researcher may design short pieces of dna probes whose sequences are complementary to the mutated sequences  these probes will seek their complement among the base pairs of an individuals genome if the mutated sequence is present in the patients genome the probe will bind to it and flag the mutation  in the second type a researcher may conduct the gene test by comparing the sequence of dna bases in a patients gene to disease in healthy individuals or their progeny genetic testing is now used for some genetic tests are already available although most of them are used in developed countries the tests currently available can detect mutations associated with rare genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia and huntingtons disease  recently tests have been developed to detect mutation for a handful of more complex conditions such as breast ovarian and colon cancers  however gene tests may not detect every mutation associated with a particular condition because many are as yet undiscovered and the ones they do detect may present different risks to different people and populations the absence of privacy and antidiscrimination legal protections in most countries can lead to discrimination in employment or insurance or other use of personal genetic information  this raises questions such as whether genetic privacy is different from medical privacy gene therapy may be used for treating or even curing genetic and acquired diseases like cancer and aids by using normal genes to supplement or replace defective genes or to bolster a normal function such as immunity it can be used to target somatic ie body or gametes ie egg and sperm cells  in somatic gene therapy the genome of the recipient is changed but this change is not passed along to the next generation  in contrast in germline gene therapy the egg and sperm cells of the parents are changed for the purpose of passing on the changes to their offspring there are basically two ways of implementing a gene therapy treatment as of june 2001 more than 500 clinical genetherapy trials involving about 3500 patients have been identified worldwide  around 78 of these are in the united states with europe having 18  these trials focus on various types of cancer although other multigenic diseases are being studied as well  recently two children born with severe combined immunodeficiency disorder scid were reported to have been cured after being given genetically engineered cells gene therapy faces many obstacles before it can become a practical approach for treating disease the human genome project is an initiative of the us department of energy doe that aims to generate a highquality reference sequence for the entire human genome and identify all the human genes the doe and its predecessor agencies were assigned by the us congress to develop new energy resources and technologies and to pursue a deeper understanding of potential health and environmental risks posed by their production and use  in 1986 the doe announced its human genome initiative shortly thereafter the doe and national institutes of health developed a plan for a joint human genome project hgp which officially began in 1990 the hgp was originally planned to last 15 years  however rapid technological advances and worldwide participation accelerated the completion date to 2003 making it a 13 year project  already it has enabled gene hunters to pinpoint genes associated with more than 30 disorders cloning involves the removal of the nucleus from one cell and its placement in an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed there are two types of cloning in february 1997 cloning became the focus of media attention when ian wilmut and his colleagues at the roslin institute announced the successful cloning of a sheep named dolly from the mammary glands of an adult female the cloning of dolly made it apparent to many that the techniques used to produce her could someday be used to clone human beings  this stirred a lot of controversy because of its ethical implications using the techniques of modern biotechnology one or two genes smartstax from monsanto in collaboration with dow agrosciences will use 8 starting in 2010 may be transferred to a highly developed crop variety to impart a new character that would increase its yield  however while increases in crop yield are the most obvious applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture it is also the most difficult one  current genetic engineering techniques work best for effects that are controlled by a single gene  many of the genetic characteristics associated with yield eg enhanced growth are controlled by a large number of genes each of which has a minimal effect on the overall yield  there is therefore much scientific work to be done in this area crops containing genes that will enable them to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses may be developed  for example drought and excessively salty soil are two important limiting factors in crop productivity  biotechnologists are studying plants that can cope with these extreme conditions in the hope of finding the genes that enable them to do so and eventually transferring these genes to the more desirable crops  one of the latest developments is the identification of a plant gene atdbf2 from arabidopsis thaliana a tiny weed that is often used for plant research because it is very easy to grow and its genetic code is well mapped out  when this gene was inserted into tomato and tobacco cells see rna interference the cells were able to withstand environmental stresses like salt drought cold and heat far more than ordinary cells if these preliminary results prove successful in larger trials then atdbf2 genes can help in engineering crops that can better withstand harsh environments  researchers have also created transgenic rice plants that are resistant to rice yellow mottle virus rymv in africa this virus destroys majority of the rice crops and makes the surviving plants more susceptible to fungal infections proteins in foods may be modified to increase their nutritional qualities  proteins in legumes and cereals may be transformed to provide the amino acids needed by human beings for a balanced diet modern biotechnology can be used to slow down the process of spoilage so that fruit can ripen longer on the plant and then be transported to the consumer with a still reasonable shelf life  this alters the taste texture and appearance of the fruit  more importantly it could expand the market for farmers in developing countries due to the reduction in spoilage  however there is sometimes a lack of understanding by researchers in developed countries about the actual needs of prospective beneficiaries in developing countries  for example engineering soybeans to resist spoilage makes them less suitable for producing tempeh which is a significant source of protein that depends on fermentation the use of modified soybeans results in a lumpy texture that is less palatable and less convenient when cooking the first genetically modified food product was a tomato which was transformed to delay its ripening  researchers in indonesia malaysia thailand philippines and vietnam are currently working on delayedripening papaya in collaboration with the university of nottingham and zeneca biotechnology in cheese production enzymes produced by microorganisms provide an alternative to animal rennet  a cheese coagulant  and an alternative supply for cheese makers  this also eliminates possible public concerns with animalderived material although there are currently no plans to develop synthetic milk thus making this argument less compelling  enzymes offer an animalfriendly alternative to animal rennet  while providing comparable quality they are theoretically also less expensive about 85 million tons of wheat flour is used every year to bake bread  by adding an enzyme called maltogenic amylase to the flour bread stays fresher longer  assuming that 1015 of bread is thrown away as stale if it could be made to stay fresh another 57 days then perhaps 2 million tons of flour per year would be saved  other enzymes can cause bread to expand to make a lighter loaf or alter the loaf in a range of ways most of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are on reducing the dependence of farmers on agrochemicals  for example bacillus thuringiensis bt is a soil bacterium that produces a protein with insecticidal qualities  traditionally a fermentation process has been used to produce an insecticidal spray from these bacteria  in this form the bt toxin occurs as an inactive protoxin which requires digestion by an insect to be effective  there are several bt toxins and each one is specific to certain target insects  crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for bt toxin which they produce in its active form  when a susceptible insect ingests the transgenic crop cultivar expressing the bt protein it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the bt toxin binding to its gut wall  bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer a lepidopteran insect which is otherwise controlled by spraying a more difficult process crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to broadspectrum herbicide the lack of herbicides with broadspectrum activity and no crop injury was a consistent limitation in crop weed management  multiple applications of numerous herbicides were routinely used to control a wide range of weed species detrimental to agronomic crops  weed management tended to rely on preemergencethat is herbicide applications were sprayed in response to expected weed infestations rather than in response to actual weeds present  mechanical cultivation and hand weeding were often necessary to control weeds not controlled by herbicide applications the introduction of herbicidetolerant crops has the potential of reducing the number of herbicide active ingredients used for weed management reducing the number of herbicide applications made during a season and increasing yield due to improved weed management and less crop injury  transgenic crops that express tolerance to glyphosate glufosinate and bromoxynil have been developed  these herbicides can now be sprayed on transgenic crops without inflicting damage on the crops while killing nearby weeds from 1996 to 2001 herbicide tolerance was the most dominant trait introduced to commercially available transgenic crops followed by insect resistance  in 2001 herbicide tolerance deployed in soybean corn and cotton accounted for 77 of the 626000 square kilometres planted to transgenic crops bt crops accounted for 15 and stacked genes for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance used in both cotton and corn accounted for 8 biotechnology is being applied for novel uses other than food  for example oilseed can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents substitute fuels and petrochemicals  potatoes tomatoes rice tobacco lettuce safflowers and other plants have been genetically engineered to produce insulin and certain vaccines if future clinical trials prove successful the advantages of edible vaccines would be enormous especially for developing countries the transgenic plants may be grown locally and cheaply  homegrown vaccines would also avoid logistical and economic problems posed by having to transport traditional preparations over long distances and keeping them cold while in transit  and since they are edible they will not need syringes which are not only an additional expense in the traditional vaccine preparations but also a source of infections if contaminated  in the case of insulin grown in transgenic plants it is wellestablished that the gastrointestinal system breaks the protein down therefore this could not currently be administered as an edible protein  however it might be produced at significantly lower cost than insulin produced in costly bioreactors  for example calgary canadabased sembiosys genetics inc reports that its safflowerproduced insulin will reduce unit costs by over 25 or more and approximates a reduction in the capital costs associated with building a commercialscale insulin manufacturing facility of over 100 million compared to traditional biomanufacturing facilities there is another side to the agricultural biotechnology issue it includes increased herbicide usage and resultant herbicide resistance super weeds residues on and in food crops genetic contamination of nongm crops which hurt organic and conventional farmers etc biotechnological engineering or biological engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on biotechnologies and biological science it includes different disciplines such as biochemical engineering biomedical engineering bioprocess engineering biosystem engineering and so on  because of the novelty of the field the definition of a bioengineer is still undefined  however in general it is an integrated approach of fundamental biological sciences and traditional engineering principles biotechnologists are often employed to scale up bio processes from the laboratory scale to the manufacturing scale  moreover as with most engineers they often deal with management economic and legal issues  since patents and regulation eg us food and drug administration regulation in the us are very important issues for biotech enterprises bioengineers are often required to have knowledge related to these issues the increasing number of biotech enterprises is likely to create a need for bioengineers in the years to come  many universities throughout the world are now providing programs in bioengineering and biotechnology as independent programs or specialty programs within more established engineering fields biotechnology is being used to engineer and adapt organisms especially microorganisms in an effort to find sustainable ways to clean up contaminated environments the elimination of a wide range of pollutants and wastes from the environment is an absolute requirement to promote a sustainable development of our society with low environmental impact  biological processes play a major role in the removal of contaminants and biotechnology is taking advantage of the astonishing catabolic versatility of microorganisms to degradeconvert such compounds  new methodological breakthroughs in sequencing genomics proteomics bioinformatics and imaging are producing vast amounts of information  in the field of environmental microbiology genomebased global studies open a new era providing unprecedented in silico views of metabolic and regulatory networks as well as clues to the evolution of degradation pathways and to the molecular adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions  functional genomic and metagenomic approaches are increasing our understanding of the relative importance of different pathways and regulatory networks to carbon flux in particular environments and for particular compounds and they will certainly accelerate the development of bioremediation technologies and biotransformation processes marine environments are especially vulnerable since oil spills of coastal regions and the open sea are poorly containable and mitigation is difficult  in addition to pollution through human activities millions of tons of petroleum enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages  despite its toxicity a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is eliminated by the hydrocarbondegrading activities of microbial communities in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists the socalled hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria hccb the national institute of health was the first federal agency to assume regulatory responsibility in the united states the recombinant dna advisory committee of the nih published guidelines for working with recombinant dna and recombinant organisms in the laboratory  nowadays the agencies that are responsible for the biotechnology regulation are  us department of agriculture usda that regulates plant pests and medical preparation from living organisms environmental protection agency epa that regulates pesticides and herbicides and the food and drug administration fda which ensures that the food and drug products are safe and effective  in 1988 after prompting from the united states congress the national institute of general medical sciences national institutes of health instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training  universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish biotechnology training programs btps each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed  graduate students in turn compete for acceptance into a btp if accepted then stipend tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their phd thesis work  nineteen institutions offer nigms supported btps biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges', 'bambaralanguage bambara belongs to a group of closelyrelated languages called manding within the larger mand group it is closely related to dioula or jula a language spoken or understood by fewer people in burkina faso cte divoire and the gambia it uses seven vowels a e  i o  and u the letters approximate their ipa equivalents writing was introduced during the french occupation and literacy is limited especially in rural areas  although written literature is only slowly evolving due to the predominance of french as the language of the educated there exists a wealth of oral literature which is often tales of kings and heroes  this oral literature is mainly tradited by the griots jliw in bambara who are a mixture of storytellers praise singers and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years  many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old kingdom of mali bambara is a national language of mali and also the most widely understood language in mali the main dialect is standard bamara which has significant influence from western maninkakan jula is a dialect in the manding linguistic continuum and is closely related to bambara it is a widelyused trade language in west africa since the 1970s bambara has mostly been written in the latin alphabet using some additional phonetic characters the vowels are a e  formerly  i o  formerly  u accents can be used to indicate tonality the former digraph ny is now written  or  senegal the ambiguous digraph ng represented both the  sound of english finger and the  of singer the 1966 bamako spelling conventions render the latter sound as  the nko  alphabet is a script devised by solomana kante in 1949 as a writing system for the mande languages of west africa nko means i say in all mande languages  kante created nko in response to what he felt were beliefs that africans were a cultureless people since prior to this time there had been no indigenous african writing system for his language  nko came first into use in kankan guinea as a maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other mandespeaking parts of west africa nko and the arabic script are still in use for bambara although the latin alphabet is much more common there are some or just one  guak hasnt found any yet after nearly 3 months in bamako   newspapers in bambara  bambara belongs to a group of closelyrelated languages called manding related to mandinka mande language group it is an sov language and has two midstandard and high tones eg sa death vs s snake  the typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject followed by an aspectival auxiliary followed by the direct object and finally a transitive verb   naturally if the verb is intransitive the direct object is not found bambara does not inflect for gender  gender for a noun can be specified by adding a suffix ce or ke for male and muso for female the plural is formed by attaching w to words bambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like english and french use prepositions  these postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction location and in some cases possession in urban areas many bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by french borrowings that often mark

keyboard go back to telegraph practices a standard telegraph key has a builtin knife switch that can be used to short the keys contacts   when the key was not in use that switch was kept closed so that a signal was continually sent if that steadystate signal was interrupted it indicated one of two things either the operator was about to start transmitting or something else had happened to break the connection  such as a physical break in the telegraph line as the teletype came into use a key was created that would temporarily interrupt the communications line allowing this practice to continue  when this occurred the receiving teletype mechanism would activate but not print characters it was typing the nonprinting del character repeatedly the noise got the operators attention timesharing computers connected to modems could recognize the break because the del characters received had bad parity  this was used to generate an interrupt allow login or stop a running program on personal computers the break key can be used by software in several different ways such as to switch between multiple login sessions to terminate a program or to interrupt a modem connection  on a bbc micro computer the break key generates an interrupt which would normally cause a warm restart of the computer a cold restart is triggered by typing ctrlbreak if a dfs rom is installed shiftbreak will cause the computer to search for and load a file calledboot on the floppy disk in drive 0 on the sinclair zx80 and zx81 computers the break is accessed by pressing space on the sinclair zx spectrum it is accessed by shift and space the spectrum and later computers have a dedicated break key it does not trigger an interrupt but will halt any running basic program or terminate the loading or saving of data to cassette tape an interrupted basic program can usually be resumed with the continue command the sinclair ql computer without a break key maps the function to ctrlspace on many modern pcs pause interrupts screen output by bios until another key is pressed  this is effective during boot in text mode and in a dos box in windows safe mode with 50 lines  on early keyboards without a pause key before the introduction of 101key keyboards the pause function was assigned to ctrlnumlock and the break function to ctrlscrlock these keycombinations still work with most programs even on modern pcs with modern keyboards  pressing the dedicated pause key on 101key keyboards sends the same scancodes as pressing ctrl then numlock then releasing them in the reverse order would do additionally an e1hex prefix is sent which enables 101key aware software to discern the two situations while older software usually just ignores the prefix the pause key is different from all other keys in that it sends no scancodes at all on release therefore it is not possible for any software to determine whether this key is being held down  on modern keyboards the break key is usually labeled pausebreak in most windows environments the key combination windows keypause brings up the system properties  compact and notebook keyboards often have the pausebreak key mapped to a function command for example ctrlfnf11 while both ctrlbreak and ctrlc combination are commonly implemented as a way of breaking the execution of a console application they are also used for similar effect in integrated development environments  although these two are often considered interchangeable compilers and execution environments usually assign different signals to these  additionally in some kernels eg miscellaneous dos variants ctrlc is detected only at the time os tries reading from a keyboard buffer and only if its the only key sequence in the buffer while ctrlbreak is often translated instantly eg by int 1bh under dos because of this ctrlbreak is usually a more effective choice under these oss sensitivity for these two combinations can be enhanced by the breakon configsys statement', 'bankruptcy the concept and origin of bankruptcy law as it is now known in the united states originated in england the first english bankruptcy law is generally agreed to have been enacted in 1542 34 and 35 henry viii c4 1542 england bankruptcy was originally planned as a remedy for creditors  not debtors  during the reign of king henry viii bankruptcy law allowed a creditor to seize all of the assets of a trader who could not pay his debts   in addition to losing all of his property the debtor also lost his freedom and was subject to imprisonment the family of the debtor had to pay the debts to obtain the release of the debtor   as time progressed however so did the rights of debtors  finally by the early 19th century in england debtors were often released from prison with their debts discharged   however for many years bankruptcy continued to be a remedy favouring creditors involuntary in nature and largely penal in character it was generally used only against traders under the english system collusive bankruptcy agreed upon by creditor and debtor was codified by the english act of 1825  collusive bankruptcy also occurred when a trader filed a declaration of insolvency in the office of the chancellors secretary of bankrupts which was then advertised the advertised declaration supported a commission in bankruptcy to be issued a law was thereafter enacted which declared that no commission grounded on this act of bankruptcy was to be deemed invalid by reason of such declaration having been concerted or agreed upon between the bankrupt and any creditor or other person  6 geo iv c16 sections vi vii eng voluntary bankruptcy was not authorized until 1849 12 and 13 vict c106 section 93 1849 eng the subject of bankruptcy was given specific recognition upon the ratification of the united states constitution in 1789   the constitution says that congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states  us const i section 8 cl4  thus the law of bankruptcy as enacted by congress is federal law the first bankruptcy act enacted by congress was in 1800   bankruptcy act of 1800 ch 62 stat 19   it was limited to traders and provided only for involuntary proceedings   voluntary bankruptcy at the time was unknown voluntary bankruptcy in the united states was allowed by the acts of 1841 act of aug 19 1841 section 1 5 stat 440 and 1867 act of mar 2 1867 section 11 14 stat 521   from these early acts to the bankruptcy act of 1898 which established the modern concepts of debtorcreditor relations to the bankruptcy act of 1938 widely known as the chandler act and to the subsequent acts the scope of voluntary access to the bankruptcy system has been broadened and voluntary petitions were made more attractive to debtors the bankruptcy reform act of 1978 commonly referred to as the bankruptcy code constituted a major overhaul of the bankruptcy system   first it covered cases filed after october 1 1979   second the 1978 act contained four titles  title i was the amended title 11 of the us code title ii contained amendments to title 28 of the us code and the federal rules of evidence title iii made the necessary changes in other federal legislation affected by the bankruptcy law changes  title iv provided for the repeal of precode bankruptcy the effective dates of portions of the new law necessary savings provisions interim housekeeping details and the pilot program of the united states trustee perhaps the most important changes to bankruptcy law under the 1978 act however were to the courts themselves the 1978 act drastically altered the structure of the bankruptcy courts and conferred pervasive subject matter jurisdiction upon the the courts the act granted the new jurisdiction over all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11  28 usc 1471b 1976 ed  supp while the new courts were denominated adjuncts of the district court they were in practice free standing courts the expanded jurisdiction was to be exercised primarily by bankruptcy judges the bankruptcy judge would continue to be an article i judge who was appointed for a set term the provisions of the 1978 act came under scrutiny in the case of northern pipeline co v marathon pipe line co 458 us 50 102 s ct 2858 73 l ed2d 598 6 cbc2d 785 1982   in marathon the name by which this supreme court case is commonly known the court held unconstitutional the broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges because those judges were not appointed under and protected by the provisions of article iii of the constitution under the united states constitution the article iii judges hold their offices during good behavior an appointment for life and their salary cannot be reduced during their tenure in office  article i judges do not enjoy such rights the jurisdictional challenge started when a creditor filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court which covered issues such as breach of contract warranty and misrepresentation the bankruptcy court denied the defendants motion to dismiss and the defendant appealed to the district court the district court held that 28 usc 1471 violated article iii of the constitution because it delegated article iii powers to a nonarticle iii court by its broad grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts   in a plurality opinion the supreme court held that the broad grant of jurisdiction accorded bankruptcy courts by 28 usc 1471 was an unconstitutional delegation of article iii powers to a nonarticle iii court similarly section 241a of the bankruptcy reform act of 1978 by establishing the jurisdictional provisions set forth in 28 usc 1471 was held unconstitutional the court stayed its judgment until october 4 1982 to give congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws   id 458 us at 89 after the stay had expired congress still failed to act  instead a model emergency rule was adopted as a local rule by the district courts the purpose of the rule was to avoid the collapse of the bankruptcy system and it was a temporary measure to provide for the orderly administration of bankruptcy cases and proceedings after marathon the rule remained in effect until enactment of the 1984 legislation on july 10 1984   although the constitutionality of the emergency rule was under constant attack the supreme court consistently denied certiorari in 1984 the legislature revised the bankruptcy code and implemented the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of 1984  by this act with few exceptions such as the trial of personal injury and wrongful death claims and matters that require consideration of both title 11 and organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce the new bankruptcy courts were allowed to exercise all of the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts   thus bankruptcy courts were allowed to hear cases such as marathon the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of 1984 in many ways resembled the bankruptcy act of 1898   among other things the law provided for the redesignation of separate units for bankruptcy judges under the district court system   bankruptcy cases pending on or filed after july 10 1984 are subject to most of the amendments relating to bankruptcy jurisdiction the bankruptcy judges united states trustees and family farmer bankruptcy act of 1986 made substantive changes relating to family farmers and established a permanent united states trustee system the 1986 act applies to cases filed since november 26 1986 the bankruptcy reform act of 1994 is effective as to cases filed on or after october 22 1994   the reform act and the case law interpreting its provisions have a great impact upon the mortgage banking industry and the servicers of mortgage loans in ancient greece bankruptcy did not exist if a man since only locally born adult males could be citizens all legal owners of property were men owed and he could not pay he and his entire household whether wife children or servants were forced into debt slavery until the creditor recouped losses via their physical labor  many citystates in ancient greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years and debt slaves had protection of life and limb which regular slaves did not enjoy  however servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that deadline by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime usually under significantly harsher conditions the word bankruptcy is formed from the ancient latin bancus a bench or table and ruptus broken a bank originally referred to a bench which the first bankers had in the public places in markets fairs etc on which they tolled their money wrote their bills of exchange etc  hence when a banker failed he broke his bank to advertise to the public that the person to whom the bank belonged was no longer in a condition to continue his business  as this practice was very frequent in italy it is said the term bankrupt is derived from the italian banco rotto broken bank see eg  ponte vecchio philip ii of spain had to declare four state bankruptcies in 1557 1560 1575 and 1596  spain became the first sovereign nation in history to declare bankruptcy the characteristic discharge of debts was introduced to angloamerican bankruptcy with the statute of 4 anne ch 17 in 1705 where the discharge of unpayable debts was offered as a reward to bankrupts who cooperated in the gathering of assets to pay what could be paid bankruptcy is also documented in east asia according to almaqrizi the yassa of genghis khan contained a provision that mandated the death penalty for anyone who became bankrupt three times in the torah or old testament every seventh year is decreed by mosaic law as a sabbatical year wherein the release of all debts that are owed by members of the community is mandated but not of foreigners the seventh sabbatical year or fortyninth year is then followed by another sabbatical year known as the year of jubilee wherein the release of all debts is mandated for fellow community members and foreigners alike and the release of all debtslaves is also mandated the year of jubilee is announced in advance on the day of atonement or the tenth day of the seventh biblical month in the fortyninth year by the blowing of trumpets throughout the land of israel in islamic teaching according to the quran an insolvent person should be allowed time to be able to pay out his debt  this is recorded in the qurans second chapter sura albaqara verse 280 which notes  and if someone is in hardship then let there be postponement until a time of ease but if you give from your right as charity then it is better for you if you only knew the principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business debt restructuring practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing financial distress so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business for private households it is argued to be insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period it is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to reoccur it has been stressed that debt advice a supervised rehabilitation period financial education and social help to find sources of income and to manage household expenditures better need to be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation reifner et al 2003 gerhardt 2009 frade 2010  in most eu member states debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtors behavior  in the united states us discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent  nevertheless it should be noted that the spectrum is broad in the eu with the uk coming closest to the us system reifner et al 2003 gerhardt 2009 frade 2010  other member states do not provide the option of a debt discharge  spain for example passed a bankruptcy law ley concursal in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt maximally half of the amount or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years gerhardt 2009 nevertheless it does not foresee debt discharge bankruptcy fraud is a whitecollar crime  while difficult to generalize across jurisdictions common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets concealment or destruction of documents conflicts of interest fraudulent claims false statements or declarations and fee fixing or redistribution arrangements  falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute perjury  multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law  in the us bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the mental state of particular actions  bankruptcy fraud is a federal crime in the united states bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from strategic bankruptcy which is not a criminal act but may work against the filer all assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a net value   this is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed it is for the creditors not the debtor to decide whether a particular asset has value the future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the us trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an unscheduled asset after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy the trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the formerly discharged creditors   whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud andor perjury would then be at the discretion of the judge andor us trustee the bankruptcy act 1966 commonwealth is the legislation that governs bankruptcy in australia only individuals can become bankrupt insolvent companies go into liquidation or administration see administration insolvency  there are three parts of the act under which the vast majority of acts of bankruptcy fall  part iv full bankruptcy part ix debt agreements and part x personal insolvency agreements agreements refer specifically to arrangements between creditors and debtors whereas part iv relates to full bankruptcy and is generally synonymous with bankruptcy a person or debtor can declare himself or herself bankrupt by lodging a debtors petition with the official receiver which is the insolvency and trustee service australia itsa a person can also be made bankrupt after a creditors petition results in the making of a sequestration order in the federal magistrates court to declare bankruptcy or for a creditors petition to be lodged a minimum debt of 5000 is required all bankrupts are required to lodge a statement of affairs document with itsa which includes important information about their assets and liabilities a bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged ordinarily a part iv bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the statement of affairs with itsa in the case of a debtors petition the statement of affairs is filed with the petition and the three year period commences immediately  however in the case of a creditors petition the statement of affairs will rarely be filed on the same day the court order is made if the bankrupt fails to lodge the document within a certain period of time he or she can be prosecuted and fined a bankruptcy trustee in most cases this is the official receiver is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate the trustees job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries ensuring that the bankrupt complies with his or her obligations under the bankruptcy act investigating the bankrupts financial affairs realizing funds to which the estate is entitled under the bankruptcy act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available for the duration of their bankruptcy all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them under the act for example a bankrupt must obtain the permission of his or her trustee to travel overseas  failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the australian federal police additionally a bankrupt is required to provide his or her trustee with details of income and assets if the bankrupt does not comply with the trustees request to provide details of income the trustee may have grounds to lodge an objection to discharge which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years the realization of funds usually comes from two main sources the bankrupts assets and the bankrupts wages  there are certain assets that are protected referred to as protected assets  these include household furniture and appliances tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value  all other assets of value will be sold if a house or car is above a certain value the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset if the bankrupt does not do this the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it the bankrupt will have to pay income contributions if his or her income is above a certain threshold the threshold is indexed biannually in march and september and varies according to the number of dependents the bankrupt has the income contributions liability is calculated by halving the amount of income that exceeds the threshold if the bankrupt fails to pay the contributions due the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupts wages if that is not possible the trustee may lodge an objection to discharge effectively extending the bankruptcy for a further five years bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three year period if all debts are paid out in full  sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an offer of composition to creditors which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed if the creditors accept the offer the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received after the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged the bankrupts credit report status will be shown as discharged bankrupt for some years the number of years varies depending on the company issuing the report but the report will eventually cease to record that information certain limited information on

bankruptcy in canada is set out by federal law in the bankruptcy and insolvency act and is applicable to businesses and individuals the office of the superintendent of bankruptcy a federal agency is responsible for ensuring that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner  trustees in bankruptcy administer bankruptcy estates bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to creditors become involved by attending creditors meetings the trustee calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes in canada a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy a consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors a typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years with the funds distributed to their creditors   even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing in most cases the creditors will accept the deal because if they dont the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy where the creditors will get even less money the creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal  once the proposal is accepted the debtor makes the payments to the proposal administrator each month or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal and the creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action if the proposal is rejected the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy a consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of 250000 not including the mortgage on their principal residence if debts are greater than 250000 the proposal must be filed under division 1 of part iii of the bankruptcy and insolvency act the assistance of a proposal administrator is required a proposal administrator is generally a licensed trustee in bankruptcy although the superintendent of bankruptcy may appoint other people to serve as administrators in 2006 there were 98450 personal insolvency filings in canada 79218 bankruptcies and 19232 consumer proposals india does not have a clear law on corporate bankruptcy even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874  the current law in force was enacted in 1920 called provincial insolvency act which consists of chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcies legal meaning of the terms bankruptcy insolvency liquidation and dissolution are contested in the indian legal system  there is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions winding up of companies is in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared see dirty thirty japan the dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the dutch bankruptcy code faillissementswet the code covers three separate legal proceedings the first is the bankruptcy faillissement the goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company the bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies the second legal proceeding in the faillissementswet is the surseance the surseance only applies to companies  its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company the third proceeding is the schuldsanering this proceeding is designed for individuals only under swiss law bankruptcy can be a consequence of insolvency it is a courtordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies in general to registered commercial entities only  in a bankruptcy all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in sweden bankruptcy swedish konkurs is a process that may involve a company or individual a creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy a person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets with some exceptions it is common for companies in sweden to reduce their debts through bankruptcy the owner or a new owner starts a new company that buys the important assets including the name from the old company which is left behind with its debts the formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals  creditors can claim money through the enforcement administration anyway and individuals do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of another because other creditors usually have priority and some debts remain unpaid  people who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure swedishskuldsanering  on application they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years and then all remaining debts are canceled the depts must not have come from crime victim compensation and the deptor must not be forbidden to run a company usually happens because of tax fraud  this process was introduced in 2006  before that all unpaid debts remained during the life of a person the most common reasons for personal insolvency in sweden are illness unemployment divorce or company bankruptcy not reckless spending in the united kingdom bankruptcy in a strict legal sense relates only to individuals and partnerships  companies and other corporations enter into differentlynamed legal insolvency procedures liquidation and administration administration order and administrative receivership  however the term bankruptcy is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation  bankruptcy in scotland is referred to as sequestration  to apply for your own bankruptcy in scotland you must have more than 1500 of debt a trustee in bankruptcy must be either an official receiver a civil servant or a licensed insolvency practitioner current law in england and wales derives in large part from the insolvency act 1986   following the introduction of the enterprise act 2002 a uk bankruptcy will now normally last no longer than 12 months and may be less if the official receiver files in court a certificate that his investigations are complete it was expected that the uk governments liberalization of the uk bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases the insolvency service statistics appear to bear this out after the increase in 2005 and 2006 the figures have remained stable the uk bankruptcy law was changed in may 2000 effective may 29 2000  debtors may now retain occupational pensions while in bankruptcy except in rare cases bankruptcy in the united states is a matter placed under federal jurisdiction by the united states constitution in article 1 section 8 clause 4 which allows congress to enact uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states the congress has enacted statute law governing bankruptcy primarily in the form of the bankruptcy code located at title 11 of the united states code federal law is amplified by state law in some places where federal law fails to speak or expressly defers to state law while bankruptcy cases are always filed in united states bankruptcy court an adjunct to the us district courts bankruptcy cases particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions are often dependent upon state law  state law therefore plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases and it is often not possible to generalize bankruptcy law across state lines generally a debtor declares bankruptcy to obtain relief from debt and this is accomplished either through a discharge of the debt or through a restructuring of the debt   generally when a debtor files a voluntary petition his or her bankruptcy case commences there are six types of bankruptcy under the bankruptcy code located at title 11 of the united states code the most common types of personal bankruptcy for individuals are chapter 7 and chapter 13  as much as 65 of all us consumer bankruptcy filings are chapter 7 cases  corporations and other business forms file under chapters 7 or 11 in chapter 7 a debtor surrenders his or her nonexempt property to a bankruptcy trustee who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtors unsecured creditors   in exchange the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt however the debtor will not be granted a discharge if he or she is guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior eg concealing records relating to financial condition and certain debts eg spousal and child support student loans some taxes will not be discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from his or her debt   many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property eg clothes household goods an older car and will not have to surrender any property to the trustee the amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state   chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight year period   generally the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues even though their debt is discharged  for example absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or reaffirm a debt the creditor with a security interest in the debtors car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged the 2005 amendments to the bankruptcy code introduced the means test for eligibility for chapter 7  an individual who fails the means test will have his or her chapter 7 case dismissed or may have to convert his or her case to a case under chapter 13 generally a trustee will sell most of the debtors assets to pay off creditors   however certain assets of the debtor are protected to some extent   for example social security payments unemployment compensation and limited values of your equity in a home car or truck household goods and appliances trade tools and books are protected  however these exemptions vary from state to state   therefore it is advisable to consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney in chapter 13 the debtor retains ownership and possession of all of his or her assets but must devote some portion of his or her future income to repaying creditors generally over a period of three to five years the amount of payment and the period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors including the value of the debtors property and the amount of a debtors income and expenses   secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors relief under chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits if youre an individual or a sole proprietor you are allowed to file for a chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of your debts   under this chapter you can propose a repayment plan in which to pay your creditors over three to five years if your monthly income is less than the states median income your plan will be for three years unless the court finds just cause to extend the plan for a longer period if your monthly income is greater than your states median income the plan must generally be for five years a plan cannot exceed the fiveyear limitation in contrast to chapter 7 the debtor in chapter 13 may keep all of his or her property whether or not exempt if the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements the bankruptcy court will typically confirm the plan and the debtor and creditors will be bound by its terms   creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan other than to object to the plan if appropriate on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the codes statutory requirements   generally the payments are made to a trustee who in turn disburses the funds in accordance with the terms of the confirmed plan when the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan the court will formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan   however if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan a bankruptcy court will often dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee   pursuant to the dismissal creditors will typically resume pursuit of state law remedies to the extent a debt remains unpaid in chapter 11 the debtor retains ownership and control of its assets and is retermed a debtor in possession dip the debtor in possession runs the day to day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the bankruptcy court in order to negotiate and complete a plan  upon meeting certain requirements eg fairness among creditors priority of certain creditors creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan if a plan is confirmed the debtor will continue to operate and pay its debts under the terms of the confirmed plan if a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan chapter 7 and chapter 13 are the efficient bankruptcy chapters often used by most individuals the chapters which almost always apply to consumer debtors are chapter 7 known as a straight bankruptcy and chapter 13 which involves an affordable plan of repayment an important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the automatic stay the automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically stops and brings to a grinding halt most lawsuits repossessions foreclosures evictions garnishments attachments utility shutoffs and debt collection harassment the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 pub l no 1098 119 stat 23 april 20 2005 bapcpa substantially amended the bankruptcy code many provisions of bapcpa were forcefully advocated by consumer lenders and were just as forcefully opposed by many consumer advocates bankruptcy academics bankruptcy judges and bankruptcy lawyers the enactment of bapcpa followed nearly eight years of debate in congress most of the laws provisions became effective on october 17 2005   upon signing the bill then president bush stated among its many changes to consumer bankruptcy law bapcpa enacted a means test which was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code the means test is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size computed over a 180 day period prior to filing if the individual must take the means test their average monthly income over this 180 day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individuals actual monthly budget if the results of the means test show no disposable incomeor in some cases a very small amount then the individual qualifies for chapter 7 relief if a debtor does not qualify for relief under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code either because of the means test or because chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts such as mortgages or vehicle loans the debtor may still seek relief under chapter 13 of the code a chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts  such as credit cards or medical bills bapcpa also requires individuals seeking bankruptcy relief to undertake credit counseling with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either chapter 7 or chapter 13   some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the bankruptcy code during 2004 the number of insolvencies reached all time highs in many european countries  in france company insolvencies rose by more than 4 in austria by more than 10 and in greece by more than 20  the increase in the number of insolvencies however does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case an increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt writeoff rates for the economy as a whole bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator  there is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy  in most cases several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings  legal tax and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures especially when comparing on an international basis  two examples the insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture  only a fraction of heavily indebted households will decide to file for insolvency  two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage no promotion this list should be very short relevant content should be incorporated into this article', 'basenji the basenji is a breed of hunting dog that was bred from stock originating in central africa most of the major kennel clubs in the englishspeaking world place the breed in the hound group more specifically it may be classified as belonging to the sighthound type the fdration cynologique internationale places the breed in group 5 spitz and primitive types and the united kennel club us places the breed in the sighthound  pariah group the basenji produces an unusual yodellike sound commonly called a barroo due to its unusually shaped larynx  this trait also gives the basenji the nickname barkless dog basenjis share many unique traits with pariah dog types  basenjis like dingos and some other breeds of dog come into estrus only once annually as compared to other dog breeds which may have two or more breeding seasons every year  both dingos and basenjis lack a distinctive odor and are prone to howls yodels and other undulated vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds  one theory holds that the latter trait is the result of the selective killing of barkier dogs in the traditional central african context because barking could lead enemies to humans forest encampments  while dogs that resemble the basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of africa the breeds original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the congo basin where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat as well as use primarily net hunting in extremely dense oldgrowth forest vegetation basenji are small elegantlooking shorthaired dogs with erect ears a tightly curled tail and a graceful neck some people consider their appearance similar to that of a miniature deer a basenjis forehead is wrinkled especially when the animal is young or extremely old  basenji eyes are typically almond shaped which gives the dog the appearance of squinting seriously dogs typically weigh 24 pounds 11kg and stand 16inches 406cm at the withers they are typically a square breed which means that they are as long as they are tall the basenji is an athletic dog and is deceptively powerful for its size they have a graceful confident gait like a trotting horse and skim the ground in a doublesuspension gallop with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running flatout at their top speed the basenji is recognized in the following standard colorations red black tricolor black with tan in the traditional pattern and brindle black stripes on a background of red all with white by the fci kc akc and ukc there are additional variations such as the trindle which is a tricolor with brindle points and several other colorations exist in the congo such as liver shaded reds and sables and capped tricolors creeping tan the basenji is alert affectionate energetic curious and reserved with strangers the basenji is somewhat aloof but can also form strong bonds with people and can become emotionally attached to a single human  basenjis may not get along with noncanine pets it is commonly patient but does best with older considerate handlers  basenjis dislike wet weather like to climb can easily get over chain wire fences and are very clever at getting their own way the basenji has the unique properties of not barking it makes a low liquid ululation instead and cleaning itself like a cat it can be described as speedy frisky tireless at play and teasing the owner into play  most basenji problems usually involve a mismatch between owner and pet  basenjis often stand on their hind legs somewhat like a meerkat by themselves or leaning on something this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something   basenjis reveal their animalofprey nature by chasing after fast moving objects that cross their paths there is apparently only one completed health survey of basenjis a 2004 uk kennel club survey many basenjis suffer from pra progressive retinal atrophy which causes blindness and fanconis syndrome which can cause kidney failure   besides fanconi syndrome and pra basenjis also suffer from hypothyroidism ipsid immunoproliferative systemic intestinal disease and ha hemolytic anemia basenjis are also sensitive to environmental and household chemicals which can cause liver problems basenjis in the 2004 uk kennel club survey had a medium longevity of 136 years sample size of 46 deceased dogs  the oldest dog in the survey was 175 years   most common causes of death were old age 30 urologic incontinence fanconi syndrome chronic kidney failure 13 behavior unspecified and aggression 9 and cancer 9 among 78 live dogs in the 2004 ukc survey the most common health issues noted by owners were dermatologic and urologic fanconi syndrome an inheritable disorder in which the kidneys fail to reabsorb electrolytes and nutrients is unusually common in basenjis   symptoms include excessive drinking excessive urination and glucose in the urine which may lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetes  fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years  fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early  basenji owners are advised to test their dogs urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years  glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies in july 2007 dr gary johnson of the university of missouri released the linked marker dna test for fanconi syndrome in basenjis it is the first predictive test available for fanconi syndrome with this test it is possible to more accurately determine the probability of a dog carrying the gene for fanconi syndrome dogs tested using this linkage test will return one of the following statuses this linkage test is being provided as a tool to assist breeders whilst research continues towards the development of the direct fanconi test for more information about the linkage test visit httpwwwbasenjihealthorglinkagefaqhtml basenji health endowment fanconi test faq basenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene which when homozygous for the defect causes genetic hemolytic anemia most 21stcentury basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean   when lineage from a fully tested line set of ancestors cannot be completely verified the dog should be tested before breeding   as this is a noninvasive dna test a basenji can be tested for ha at any time basenjis sometimes suffer from hip dysplasia resulting in loss of mobility and arthritislike symptoms  all dogs should be tested by either ofa or pennhip prior to breeding malabsorption or immunoproliferative enteropathy is an autoimmune intestinal disease  that leads to anorexia chronic diarrhea and even death a special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs the breed can also fall victim to progressive retinal atrophy a degeneration of the retina causing blindness and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as coloboma a hole in the eye structure and persistent pupillary membrane tiny threads across the pupil the basenji is arguably one of the most ancient dog breeds  originating on the continent of africa  basenjilike dogs have lived with humans for thousands of years  dogs resembling modern basenjis can be seen on stelae in the tombs of egyptian pharaohs sitting at the feet of their masters looking just as they do today with pricked ears and tightly curled tails   dogs of this type were originally kept for hunting small game by coursing europeans first described the type of dog from which the basenji breed was derived in the congo in 1895  these local dogs which europeans identified as a unique breed and called basenji were prized by locals for their intelligence courage speed and silence  however an article published called the intelligence of dogs  by  stanley coren phd questions this it ranks the breed at 78 out of 79 which is the second to lowest rank in intelligence basenjis were assistants to the hunt chasing wild game into nets for their masters the azande and mangbetu people from the northeastern congo region describe basenjis in the local lingala language as mbw na basnzi   translated this means dogs of the savages or dogs of the villagers  in the congo the basenji is also known as dog of the bush the dogs are also known to the azande of southern sudan as ango angari the word basnzi itself is the plural form of mosnzi  in swahili another bantu language from east africa mbwa shenzi translates to wild dog   another local name is mbwa mkube mbwa wamwitu or jumping up and down dogdateseptember 2010 a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry several attempts were made to bring the breed to england but the earliest imports succumbed to disease   in 1923 for example lady helen nutting brought six basenjis with her from sudan but all six died from distemper shots they received in quarantine it was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in england and then to the united states by animal importer henry trefflich so it is that nearly all the basenjis in the western world are descended from these few original imports the breed was officially accepted into the akc in 1943   in 1990 the akc stud book was reopened to fourteen new imports at the request of the basenji club of america the stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from january 1 2009 to december 31 2013  an american led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the basankusu area of the democratic republic of congo in 2010  basenjis are also registered with the ukc although in the past it was speculated that basenjis were somehow descended from jackals modern genetic testing shows that basenjis are related to all other dogs and are descended from the wolf canis lupus    however further study is needed to determine whether they belong to the subspecies canis lupus familiaris as is the case with most dogs or rather into the taxon canis lupus dingo which includes such the new guinea singing dog the telomian the australian dingo and thai ridgeback canis lupus dingo', 'blitzbasic the term blitz basic is often used to refer to the general syntax used in the entire range of blitz languages as well as the original product that started them the first blitz language that was designed by mark sibly was for the amiga computer and published by the australian company memory and storage technology after returning to new zealand blitz2 was published several years later by acid software a local 90s amiga game publisher otherwise known as blitz2d blitz basic was released in october 2000 for microsoft windows and allowed only 2d graphics it was published by idigicon recognition of blitz basic increased when a limited range of free versions were distributed on popular uk computer magazines such as pc format this resulted in a legal dispute between the developer and publisher which was eventually amicably resolved although originally blitz3ds distribution rights were owned by idigicon blitz research ltd later signed a deal with the firm so as to allow blitz research ltd to distribute blitz3d themselves   in return idigicon were granted full rights to distribute blitz basic and to clear any outstanding stock copies of blitz 3d in february 2003 blitz research ltd released blitzplus also for microsoft windows it does not have the 3d engine of blitz3d but does bring new features to the 2d side of the language by implementing limited microsoft windows control support for creating native guis  backwards compatibility of the 2d engine was also extended allowing compiled blitzplus games and applications to run on systems that might only provide directx 1 support blitzmax is the most recent language released by blitz research ltd unlike previous blitz products code can be compiled on nix platforms too the mac os x compiler was released first in december 2004 followed by compilers for microsoft windows and linux in may 2005   blitzmax brought the largest change of language structure to the modern range of blitz products by adding objectoriented concepts and adapting the graphics layer to better suit  opengl  blitzmax is also the first of the blitz languages to represent strings internally using ucs2 allowing writing programs that use characters outside the standard ascii character set blitzmax is also the first modular version of the blitz languages improving the extensibility of the commandset  in addition all of the standard modules shipped with the compiler are opensource and so can be tweaked and recompiled by the programmer if necessary the official blitzmax crossplatform gui module known as maxgui allows developers to write gui interfaces for their applications on linux fltk mac cocoa and windows  various usercontributed modules extend the use of the language by wrapping such libraries as wxwidgets cairo fontconfig as well as a selection of database modules   there are also a selection of thirdparty 3d modules available for blitzmax such as minib3d an opensource opengl engine which can be compiled and used on all 3 of blitzmaxs supported platforms blitzmax is able to produce crossplatform applications as blitzmax source code is designed to be platform agnostic  as such code developed on one platform should behave similarly when recompiled on any of the other supported platforms   however the official compiler and build chain will only generate binaries for the platform that it is executing on  unofficially users have been able to get linux and mac os x to crosscompile to the window platform in october 2007 blitzmax 126 included the addition of a reflection module   blitzmax 132 ships with new threading and lua scripting modules and most of the standard library functions have been updated so that they are unicode friendly the latest product from blitz research limited a 3d graphics engine based on the engine in blitz3d it is designed to be used with c c blitzmax and purebasic however it can be used with other languages in 2008 blitz research released the source code to max3d under a bsd license a crossplatform 3d engine purported to have been in development for quite some time max3d was written in c and made use of several open source libraries namely assimp boost and ode the engine focused on opengl but had an abstract backend for other graphics drivers such as directx interest and support died off over time and eventually development came to a halt  there is no indication that blitz research will pickup the project again the following code creates a windowed application that shows the current time in binary and decimal format  this code is written in blitz basic but will compile and run in both blitz3d and blitzplus see below for the same example written in blitzmax apptitle binary clock

century the battle of abritus also known as the battle of forum terebronii occurred in the roman province of moesia inferior modern razgrad bulgaria probably in july 251 between the roman empire and a federation of scythian tribesmen under the goth king cniva the romans were soundly defeated and roman emperors decius and his son herennius etruscus were both killed during battle they became the first roman emperors killed in a battle with a foreign enemy the battle typically marks the starting of a period of increased military and political instability in the roman empire although the symptoms of the crisis had already appeared in the preceding decades the course of events is not clear it seems that in 250 the carpi invaded dacia eastern moesia superior and western moesia inferior it is quite possible that other people of germanic and sarmatian origin like bastarnae taifals and hasdingian vandals perhaps roman deserters as well had joined the invaders the first column of cnivas army a detachment likely led by the chieftains argaith and gunteric besieged marcianopolis without success it seems  then they probably headed south to besiege philippopolis now plovdiv in bulgaria cnivas main column under the king himself crossed danube at oescus then headed eastwards to novae where he was repelled by the provincial governor and future emperor trebonianus gallus then the invaders headed south to plunder nicopolis ad istrum where decius defeated them but not decisively  after these initial setbacks the barbarians moved southwards through haemus mountain and decius pursued them likely through the shipka pass to save philippopolis it seems that priscus after receiving the news of the defeat at beroe thought that the goths would spare him and the city he was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell  then the scythians began returning to their homeland laden with booty and captives among them many of senatorial rank in the meantime decius had returned with his reorganized army accompanied by his son herennius etruscus and the general trebonianus gallus intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty probably in july or august of 251 the roman army engaged the scythians under cniva near abritus the strengths of the bellingerent forces are unknown but we know that cniva divided his forces into three units with one of these parts concealed behind a swamp  jordanes and aurelius victor claim that herennius etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter he allegedly said let no one mourn the death of one soldier is not a great loss to the republic however other sources state that herennius died with his father the manoeuvre of the scythians was ultimately successful  decius forces defeated their opponents in the front line but made the fatal mistake of pursuing their fleeing enemy into the swamp where they were ambushed and routed the immense slaughter marked one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of the roman empire and resulted in the death of decius himself  zonaras vividly narrates how he and his son and a large number of romans fell into the marshland all of them perished there none of their bodies to be found as they were covered by the mud lactantius a christian apologist of the early 4th century deeply hating decius for the persecution of christians resulted from his edict on sacrifices described the emperors demise as following  the supposedly treacherous behavior of treboniannus gallus who according to zosimus signalled the final gothic assault is not accepted today it seems impossible that the shattered roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks  another strong point against gallus treason is the fact that he adopted hostilian the younger son of decius after returning to rome the longdebated location of abritus was finally established 1km east of the city of razgrad after the excavations published by t ivanov in 1969 and 1971 gallus who became emperor upon decius death negotiated a treaty with the goths under duress which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the danube it is also possible that he agreed to pay  an annual tribute in return for the goths promise to respect roman territory  this humiliating treaty the contemporary spread of plague with its devastating effects and the chaotic situation in the east with the sassanian invasions left gallus with a very bad reputation amongst the latter roman historians  however d s potter suggests that before the defeat at abritus the situation was not so serious that the available roman forces would not be able to manage the invasions  therefore it is decius bad conduct which was responsible for the disastrous turn of the events  in any case gallus had no choice but to get rid of the goths as soon as possible ammianus marcellinus rated this reverse with the most serious military disasters of the roman empire to his time  varus defeat at the battle of the teutoburg forest the incursions of the marcomanni during the reign of marcus aurelius and the battle of adrianople in 271 the emperor aurelian conclusively defeated the goths and killed their king cannobaudes in battle  based on the similarity of the names that king might coincide with the king cniva who defeated decius in abritus', 'bentley before world war i wo bentley had been in partnership with his brother hm bentley selling french dfp cars but he had always wanted to design and build his own range of cars bearing his name   in august 1919 bentley motors ltd was registered and a chassis with dummy engine was exhibited at the london motor show in october of that year an engine was built and running by december and orders were taken for deliveries starting in june 1920 however development took longer than estimated and the first cars were not ready until september 1921 it was on a visit to the dfp factory in 1913 that wo noticed an aluminium paperweight and had the inspired idea of using the lightweight metal instead of cast iron to make engine pistons the first bentley aluminium pistons went into service in aero engines for the sopwith camel during the great war the company was always underfunded and bentley turned to millionaire woolf barnato for help in 1925   as part of a refinancing deal which resulted in his effectively owning the company barnato became chairman a group of wealthy british motorists known as the bentley boys woolf barnato sir henry birkin steeplechaser george duller aviator glen kidston automotive journalist sch sammy davis and dr dudley benjafield among them kept the marques reputation for high performance alive  thanks to the dedication to serious racing of this group the company located at cricklewood north london was noted for its four consecutive victories at the 24 hours of le mans from 1927 to 1930   their greatest competitor at the time bugattiwhose lightweight elegant but fragile creations contrasted with the bentleys rugged reliability and durabilityreferred to them as the worlds fastest lorries in march 1930 during the blue train races woolf barnato raised the stakes on rover and its rover light six having raced and beat le train bleu for the first time to better that record with his 6litre bentley speed six on a bet of 100   he drove against the train from cannes to calais then by ferry to dover and finally london travelling on public highways and won the hj mullinerbodied formal saloon he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback sportsman coup by gurney nutting  he took delivery of on 21 may 1930 became known as the blue train bentleys the latter is regularly mistaken for or erroneously referred to as being the car that raced the blue train while in fact barnato named it in memory of his race the original model was the 3litre but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis a larger 4litre model followed   perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4litre blower bentley with its distinctive supercharger projecting forward from the bottom of the grille   uncharacteristically fragile for a bentley it was not the racing workhorse the 6litre was it became famous in popular media as the vehicle of james bond in the original novels but not in film john steed in the television series the avengers drove a bentley while a great deal of woolf barnatos fortune had been devoted to keeping bentley afloat the great depression destroyed demand for the companys expensive products and it was finally sold to rollsroyce in 1931 rollsroyce acquired bentley secretly using an entity named the british central equitable trust not even bentley himself knew the true identity of the purchaser until the deal was completed when the new bentley 35 litre appeared in 1933 it was a sporting variant of the rollsroyce 2025 which disappointed some traditional customers yet was wellreceived by many others   even bentley himself was reported as saying taking all things into consideration i would rather own this bentley than any other car produced under that name after world war ii production of rollsroyce and bentley cars was moved to an exwartime engine factory in crewe cheshire bentleys increasingly became slightly lower priced rollsroyces sans the rolls distinctive squareshouldered grille   by the 1970s and early 1980s sales had fallen badly at one point less than 5 of combined production carried the bentley badge during this period rollsroyces parent company faltered failing completely in 1970 following problems with aero engine development the motorcar division was floated off and became rollsroyce motors ltd which remained independent until bought by vickers plc in august 1980 under vickers bentley began to regain its highperformance heritage typified by the 1980 mulsanne  bentleys restored sporting image created a renewed interest in the name and sales as a proportion of combined company output began to rise   by 1986 the rollsroycebentley ratio had reached 6040 by 1991 it achieved parity for more on bentley motors from 1931 to 1998 see rollsroyce and rollsroyce motors in 1998 rollsroyce and bentley motors were purchased from vickers plc by volkswagen group for 430 million following a bidding war with bmw  bmw had recently started supplying components for the new range of rolls and bentley cars notably v8 engines for the bentley arnage and v12 engines for the rollsroyce silver seraph  volkswagen group believed that the rollsroyce name was included in the purchase when in fact it belonged to rollsroyce plc the aeroengine company and was used by the automobile division under licence it also emerged that bmws aeronautical division had a joint venture agreement with rollsroyce plc and that the german company was able to terminate its supply deal with rollsroyce with 12 months notice which would not be enough time for volkswagen group to reengineer the cars bmw and volkswagen group entered into negotiations and an agreement was reached whereby volkswagen group would manufacture both bentley and rollsroyce cars until the end of 2002 licensing the name from rollsroyce plc on 1 january 2003 the right to build rollsroyce cars would transfer to bmw  bmw licensed the brand from rollsroyce plc and paid 40 million to volkswagen group but the deal did not include any manufacturing facilities staff or intellectual property on present or future models   bmw also agreed to continue its supply agreements which gave volkswagen group the time it needed to reduce its reliance on bmw as a supplier   bentley reintroduced the venerable rollsroyce v8 engine into the arnage initially as an additional model and all bmw engine supply ended in 2003 with the end of silver seraph production after acquiring the company volkswagen spent 500 million to modernize the crewe factory and increase production capacity as of early 2010 there are about 3500 working at crewe compared with about 1500 in 1998 before being taken over by volkswagen it was reported that volkswagen invested a total of nearly us2 billion in bentley and its revival in 2002 bentley presented queen elizabeth ii with an official state limousine to celebrate the golden jubilee in 2003 bentleys 2door convertible the bentley azure ceased production and the company introduced a second line bentley continental gt a large luxury coup powered by a w12 engine built in crewe demand had been so great that the factory at crewe was unable to meet orders despite an installed capacity of approximately 9500 vehicles per year there was a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered   consequently part of the production of the new flying spur a fourdoor version of the continental gt was assigned to the transparent factory germany where the volkswagen phaeton luxury car is also assembled   this arrangement ceased at the end of 2006 after around 1000 cars with all car production reverting to the crewe plant in april 2005 bentley confirmed plans to produce a four seat convertible modelthe azure derived from the arnage drophead coup prototypeat crewe beginning in 2006   by the autumn of 2005 the convertible version of the successful continental gt the continental gtc was also presented   these two models were successfully launched in late 2006 a limited run of a zagato modified gt was also announced in march 2008 dubbed gtz a new bentley version of the bentley continental was introduced at the 2009 geneva auto show the  continental supersports this new bentley is a supercar combining

linnaeus got most of his higher education at uppsala university and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730  he lived abroad between 17351738 where he studied and also published a first edition of his systema naturae in the netherlands he then returned to sweden where he became professor of botany at uppsala in the 1740s he was sent on several journeys through sweden to find and classify plants and animals  in the 1750s and 60s he continued to collect and classify animals plants and minerals and published several volumes at the time of his death he was renowned as one of the most acclaimed scientists in europe the swiss philosopher jeanjacques rousseau sent him the message  tell him i know no greater man on earth the german writer johann wolfgang von goethe wrote  with the exception of shakespeare and spinoza i know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly   among other compliments linnaeus has been called princeps botanicorum prince of botanists the pliny of the north and the second adam in botany the author abbreviation used to indicate linnaeus as the authority for species names is simply l in 1959 carl linnaeus was designated as lectotype for homo sapiens which means that following the nomenclatural rules homo sapiens was validly defined as the animal species to which linnaeus belonged carl linnaeus was born in rshult smland sweden on the 23 may 1707  he was the first child of nils ingemarsson linnaeus and christina brodersonia his father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent last name before that ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of scandinavian countries   his father adopted the latinform name linnus after a giant linden tree on the family homestead  this name was spelled with the  ligature which was also used by his son carl in his handwritten documents and publications nils was from a long line of peasants and priests   nils was an amateur botanist a lutheran minister and the curate of the small village of stenbrohult in smland christina was the daughter of the rector of stenbrohult samuel brodersonius she subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son samuel who would eventually succeed their father as rector of stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping a year after linnaeus birth his grandfather samuel brodersonius died and his father nils became the rector of stenbrohult thus linnaeus and his parents could move into the rectory instead of the curates house where they had lived before even in his early years linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants flowers in particular  whenever he was upset he was given a flower which immediately calmed him  nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to linnaeus and told him their names  soon linnaeus was given his own patch of earth in his fathers garden where he could grow plants his father began teaching linnaeus latin religion and geography at an early age one account says that due to much use of latin for household conversation he learned latin before he learned swedish when linnaeus was seven nils considered it better for him to have a tutor  his parents picked johan telander a son of a local yeoman  telander was not appreciated by linnaeus who later wrote in his autobiography that telander was better calculated to extinguish a childs talents than develop them  two years after his tutoring had begun in 1717 he was instead sent to the lower grammar school at vxj linnaeus rarely studied instead he often went to the countryside to look for plants  nevertheless linnaeus managed to reach the last year of the lower school when he was fifteen  this year was taught by the headmaster daniel lannerus who was interested in botany  lannerus noticed linnaeus interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden he also introduced him to johan rothman who was the state doctor of smland and teacher at vxj gymnasium rothman being a doctor and thus at that time also a botanist widened linnaeus interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine after having spent the last seven years in a grammar school linnaeus entered the vxj gymnasium in 1724  at the gymnasium he studied mainly greek hebrew theology and mathematics a curriculum designed for someone who intended on a future as a priest  in the last year at the gymnasium linnaeus father nils visited to ask the professors at the gymnasium how linnaeus studies were progressing to his dismay most of them told him that linnaeus would never become a scholar  however rothman believed otherwise and suggested that linnaeus could have a future in medicine  rothman also offered that he would give linnaeus a home in vxj and teach him physiology and botany  nils gratefully accepted this offer rothman showed linnaeus that botany was a serious subject and not only a simple hobby he taught linnaeus to classify plants according to tourneforts system  linnaeus was also taught about sexuality of plants according to sbastien vaillant linnaeus was offered tutoring and lodging by the local doctor kilian stobaeus there he could use the doctors library including many books about botany and was given free admission to the doctors lectures  in his free time linnaeus explored the flora of skne together with students sharing the same interests in august 1728 linnaeus decided to attend uppsala university on the advice of rothman who believed it would be a better choice if linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany  rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at medical faculty at uppsala olof rudbeck the younger and lars roberg both rudbeck and roberg had undoubtedly been good professors once but at that time they were old and not interested in teaching anymore  rudbeck for example no longer gave public lectures himself letting a less able person stand in for him  thus the botany zoology pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state  in uppsala linnaeus met a new benefactor olof celsius celsius was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist he received linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library which was one of the richest botanical libraries in sweden in 1729 linnaeus wrote a thesis praeludia sponsaliorum plantarum on plant sexuality  this attracted the attention of olof rudbeck in may 1730 he selected linnaeus to begin giving lectures at the university even though linnaeus was only a second year student the lectures were very popular and linnaeus could often find himself addressing an audience of 300 persons  in june linnaeus moved from celsius house into rudbecks house to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children  his friendship with celsius did not wane they continued to go on botanical expeditions  during that winter linnaeus began doubting tourneforts system of classification and decided to create one of his own  his plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils he began writing several books which would later result in for example genera plantarum and critica botanica he also produced a book concerning the plants grown in uppsala botanical garden adonis uplandicus rudbecks former assistant nils rosn returned to the university in march 1731 with a degree in medicine  rosn started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over linnaeus lectures in botany an attempt stopped by rudbeck until december rosn gave linnaeus private tutoring in medicine  in december linnaeus had a disagreement with rudbecks wife and had to move out of rudbecks house his relationship with rudbeck went seemingly unharmed  that christmas linnaeus returned home to stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years  his mothers feelings for him had grown cold since he had chosen not to become a priest but when she heard that he was teaching at the university she was pleased during a visit with his parents linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to lapland a journey which rudbeck had taken once in 1695 but the results of which had been lost in a 1702 fire  linnaeus hope was to find new plants animals and possibly valuable minerals he was also curious of the customs of the native sami people reindeerherding nomads who wandered scandinavias vast tundras  in april 1732 linnaeus was awarded a grant from the royal society of sciences in uppsala for his journey linnaeus began his expedition on 22 may he travelled on foot and horse bringing with him his journal botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants it took him 11 days to reach his first destination ume sometimes dismounting on the way to examine a flower or rock he was particularly interested in mosses and lichens the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer a common animal in lapland next he reached gvle where he found great quantities of campanula serpyllifolia later known as linnaea borealis the twinflower that would become his favourite after gvle linnaeus began journeying to lycksele a town further away from the coast than he had traveled up till then examining waterbirds on the way  after five days he reached the town and stayed with the pastor and his wife  see eg tablut from ume he travelled further north into the scandinavian mountains passing old lule where he received a sami womans cap on the way  here he crossed the border to norway into srfold about convert300 from old lule subsequently he traveled to kalix where he received instructions in assaying  in the middle of september he began his journey back to uppsala travelling through finland taking the boat from bo he returned from his six month long over convert2000 expedition on 10 october having gathered and observed many plants birds and rocks  though lapland was a region with limited biodiversity linnaeus was able to describe about one hundred previously unknown plants  his discoveries would later become the basis of his book flora lapponica in 1734 linnaeus led a small group of students to dalarna the trip funded by the governor of dalarna aimed to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones but also included gathering intelligence on norwegian mining activities at rros back in uppsala linnaeus relations with nils rosn worsened and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student claes sohlberg to spend the christmas holiday in falun with sohlbergs family  sohlbergs father was a mining inspector and let linnaeus visit the mines near falun sohlands father suggested to linnaeus that he should bring sohlberg to holland and continue to tutor him there for an annual pay  at that time holland was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for swedes to take their doctors degree linnaeus who was interested in both of these accepted in april 1735 linnaeus and sohlberg set out for the netherlands with linnaeus to take a doctors degree in medicine at the university of harderwijk on the way they stopped in hamburg here they met the mayor who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed the taxidermied remains of a sevenheaded hydra  linnaeus quickly discovered that it was a fake jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together the provenance of the hydra suggested to linnaeus that it had been manufactured by monks to represent the beast of revelation as much as this may have upset the mayor linnaeus made his observations public and the mayors dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined  fearing his wrath linnaeus and sohlberg had to leave hamburg quickly when linnaeus reached harderwijk he started taking his degree immediately  first he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria that he had written in sweden he then defended his thesis in a public debate the next step was to take an oral exam and to diagnose a patient  after less than two weeks he took his degree and became a doctor at the age of 28  during the summer linnaeus met a friend from uppsala peter artedi prior to their departure from uppsala artedi and linnaeus had decided that should one of them die the survivor would finish the others work  ten weeks later artedi drowned in one of the canals of amsterdam and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to linnaeus to complete one of the first scientists linnaeus met in the netherlands was johan frederik gronovius to whom linnaeus showed one of his several manuscripts he had brought with him from sweden the manuscript described a new system for classifying plants  when gronovius saw it he was very impressed and offered to help pay for the printing  with an additional monetary contribution by the scottish doctor isaac lawson the manuscript was published as systema naturae linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the netherlands herman boerhaave who tried to convince linnaeus to make a career there  boerhaave offered him a journey to south africa and america but linnaeus declined stating he would not stand the heat  instead boerhaave suggested that linnaeus visit the botanist johannes burman which linnaeus did  after linnaeus visit burman impressed with his guests knowledge decided that linnaeus should stay with him during the winter  during his stay linnaeus helped burman with his thesaurus zeylanicus burman also helped linnaeus with the books he was working on  fundamenta botanica and bibliotheca botanica in august during linnaeus stay with burman he met george clifford iii a director of the dutch east india company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of hartecamp in heemstede clifford was very impressed with linnaeus ability to classify plants and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden  linnaeus had already agreed to stay with burman over the winter and could thus not accept immediately  however clifford offered to compensate burman by offering him a copy of sir hans sloanes natural history of jamaica a rare book if he let linnaeus stay with him and burman accepted  on 24 september 1735 linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at hartecamp free to buy any book or plant he wanted in july 1736 linnaeus travelled to england at cliffords expense he went to london to visit sir hans sloane a collector of natural history and see his cabinet as well as to visit the chelsea physic garden and its keeper philip miller he taught miller about his new system of subdividing plants as described in systema naturae miller was impressed and from then on started to arrange the garden according to linnaeus system  linnaeus also traveled to oxford university to visit the botanist johann jacob dillenius he failed however to make dillenius publicly accept his new classification system he then returned to hartecamp bringing with him many specimens of rare plants the next year he published genera plantarum in which he described 935 genera of plants shortly thereafter supplemented by corollarium generum plantarum with another sixty sexaginta genera his work at hartecamp led to another book hortus cliffortianus a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of hartecamp written in nine months completed in july 1737 but not published until 1738 linnaeus stayed with clifford at hartecamp until 18 october 1737 new style when he left the house in order to return to sweden illness and the kindness of dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in holland in may 1738 he set out for sweden again  on the way home he stayed in paris for about a month visiting botanists such as antoine de jussieu after his return linnaeus never left sweden again when linnaeus returned to sweden 28 june 1738 he went to falun where he entered into an engagement to sara elisabeth mora three months later he moved to stockholm to find employment as a physician and thus making it possible to support a family  once again linnaeus found a patron he became acquainted with count carl gustav tessin who helped linnaeus get work as a physician at the admiralty during this time in stockholm linnaeus helped found the royal swedish academy of science linnaeus became the first praeses in the academy by drawing of lots because his economy had improved and was now sufficient to support a family he received permission to marry his fiance sara elisabeth mora their wedding was held 26 june 1739  seven months later sara gave birth to their first son carl two years later a daughter elisabeth christina was born and the subsequent year sara gave birth to sara magdalena who died at 15 days old  sara and linnaeus would later have four other children  lovisa sara christina johannes and sophia in may 1741 linnaeus was appointed professor of medicine at uppsala university first with the responsibility of the medicinerelated matters  soon he changed place with the other professor of medicine nils rosn and thus was responsible for the botanical garden which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand botany and natural history instead  in october that same year his wife and nineyearold son followed him to live in uppsala ten days after he was appointed professor he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of land and gotland with six students from the university to look for plants useful in medicine  first they travelled to land and stayed there until 21 june when they sailed to visby in gotland linnaeus and the students stayed on gotland for about a month and then returned to uppsala during this expedition they found 100 previously unrecorded plants the observations from the expedition were later published in lndska och gothlndska resa written in swedish like flora lapponica it contained both zoological and botanical observations as well as observations concerning the culture in land and gotland during the summer of 1745 linnaeus published two more books  flora suecica and fauna suecica flora suecica was a strictly botanical book while fauna suecica was zoological  anders celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742  celsius scale was inverted compared to today the boiling point at 0c and freezing point at 100c  in 1745 linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard in the summer of 1746 linnaeus was once again commissioned by the government to carry out an expedition this time to the swedish province vstergtland he set out from uppsala 12 june and returned 11 august  on the expedition his primarily companion was erik gustaf lidbeck a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey  linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book wstgtaresa published the next year  after returning from the journey the government decided linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province scania this journey was postponed as linnaeus felt too busy in 1747 linnaeus was given the title archiater or chief physician by the swedish king adolf fredericka mark of great respect the same year he was elected member of the academy of sciences in berlin in the spring of 1749 linnaeus could finally journey to scania again commissioned by the government with him he brought his student olof sderberg on the way to scania he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year the expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and swedish whitebeam these trees were used by the military to make rifles the journey was successful and linnaeus observations were published the next year in sknska resa in 1750 linnaeus became rector of uppsala university starting a period where specifically natural sciences were esteemed  his lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the botanical garden he tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody not even him  even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every saturday during summer where linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of uppsala linnaeus published philosophia botanica in 1751  the book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system linnaeus had been using in his earlier works it also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden in 1753 linnaeus published species plantarum the work whichtogether with his earlier work systema naturaeis internationally accepted as the beginning of modern botanical nomenclature the book contained 1200 pages and was published in two volumes it described over 7300 species the same year he was dubbed knight of the order of the polar star by the king  linnaeus was the first civilian in sweden to become a knight in this order he was then seldom seen not wearing the order linnaeus felt uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy and thus he bought two farms in 1758  hammarby and svja the next year he bought a neighbouring farm edeby together with his family he spent the summers at hammarby first only a small onestorey house but expanded with a new bigger main building in 1762  in hammarby linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the botanical garden in uppsala he began constructing a museum on a hill behind hammarby in 1766 where he moved his library and collection of plants the reason for the move was a fire that destroyed about one third of uppsala and had threatened his residence there since the initial release of systema naturae in 1735 the book had been expanded and reprinted several times the tenth edition was released in 1758  this edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature the equivalent of species plantarum the swedish king adolf frederick granted linnaeus nobility in 1757 but he was not ennobled until 1761  he took the name von linn becoming carl von linn the noble familys coat of arms prominently features a twinflower one of linnaeus favourite plants it was given the scientific name linnaea borealis in his honour by gronovius the shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds red black and green for the three kingdoms of nature animal mineral and vegetable in linnaean classification in the center is an egg to denote nature which is continued and perpetuated in ovo  at the bottom is a phrase in latin borrowed from the aeneid which reads famam extendere factis we extend our fame by our deeds linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the royal swedish academy of science in 1763 but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after linnaeus last years were troubled by illness he had suffered from a disease called the uppsala fever in 1764 but survived thanks to the care of rosn he got sciatica in 1773 and the next year he had a stroke which partially paralysed him  in 1776 he suffered a second stroke losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory while still able to admire his own writings he could not recognize himself as their author in december 1777 he had another stroke which greatly weakened him and eventually led to his death 10 january 1778 in hammarby despite his desire to be buried in hammarby he was interred in uppsala cathedral 22 january his library and collections were left to his widow sara and their children  joseph banks an english botanist wanted to buy the collection but carl refused and moved the collection to uppsala however in 1783 carl died and sara inherited the collection having outlived both her husband and son she tried to sell it to banks but he was no longer interested instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection the acquaintance was a 24 year old medical student james edward smith who bought the whole collection 14000 plants 3198 insects 1564 shells about 3000 letters and 1600 books  smith founded the linnean society of london five years later during linnaeus time as professor and rector of uppsala university he taught many devoted students 17 of whom he called apostles they were the most promising most committed students and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world often with the help of linnaeus the amount of this help varied sometimes he used his influence as rector to grant his apostles a place on an expedition or a scholarship  to most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to find on their journeys  abroad the apostles collected and organised new plants animals and minerals according to linnaeus system  most of them also gave some of their collection to linnaeus when their journey was finished  thanks to these students the linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without linnaeus ever having to travel outside sweden after his return from holland the british botanist william t stearn notes that without linnaeus new system it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organize so many new specimens  many of the apostles died during their expeditions christopher trnstrm the first apostle and a 43yearold pastor with a wife and children made his journey in 1746  he boarded a swedish east india company ship headed for china trnstrm never reached his destination having died of a tropical fever on cn sn island the same year  trnstrms widow blamed linnaeus for making her children fatherless causing linnaeus to prefer sending out younger unmarried students after trnstrm six other apostles later died on their expeditions including the apostles pehr forsskl and pehr lfling two years after trnstrms expedition finnishborn pehr kalm set out as the second apostle to north america there he spent twoandahalf years studying the flora and fauna of pennsylvania new york new jersey and canada linnaeus was overjoyed when kalm returned bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds  at least 90 of the 700 north american species described in species plantarum had been brought by kalm daniel solander was living in linnaeus house during his time as a student in uppsala linnaeus was very fond of him promising solander his oldest daughters hand in marriage  on linnaeus recommendation solander travelled to england in 1760 where he met the english botanist joseph banks together with banks solander joined james cook on his expedition to oceania on the endeavour in 176871  solander was not the only apostle to journey with james cook anders sparrman followed on the resolution in 177275 bound for among others oceania and south america sparrman made many other expeditions one of them to south africa perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was carl peter thunberg who embarked on a nineyearlong expedition in 1770  he stayed in south africa for three years and then travelled to japan all foreigners in japan were forced to stay on the island of dejima outside nagasaki and it was thus hard for thunberg to study the flora  however he managed to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants and also found plants in the gardens of dejima he returned to sweden in 1779 one year after linnaeus death the first edition of systema naturae was printed in the netherlands in 1735  it was a twelve page work  by the time it reached its 10th edition 1758 it classified 4400 species of animals and 7700 species of plants  in it the unwieldy names mostly used at the time such as physalis annua ramosissima ramis angulosis glabris foliis dentatoserratis were supplemented with concise and now familiar binomials composed of the generic name followed by a specific epithet  in the case given physalis angulata  these binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species  higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner  although the system now known as binomial nomenclature was developed by the bauhin brothers see gaspard bauhin and johann bauhin almost 200 years earlier linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work also in monospecific genera and may be said to have popularized it within the scientific community linnaeus named taxa in ways that struck him as commonsensical for example human beings are homo sapiens see sapience he also briefly described a second human species homo troglodytes cavedwelling man  this name was based on a figure and description by bontius 1658 the figure referred to a female indonesian or malayan human and the description to an orang utan the group mammalia were named for their mammary glands because one of the defining characteristics of mammals is that they nurse their young in 1754 linnaeus divided the plant kingdom into 25 classes  one cryptogamia included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts algae fungi mosses and liverworts and ferns the establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was linnaeus main contribution to taxonomyhis work marks the starting point of binomial nomenclature   in addition linnaeus developed during the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge what became known as the linnaean taxonomy the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences the linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy starting with three kingdoms  kingdoms were divided into classes and they in turn into orders which were divided into genera singular genus which were divided into species singular species  below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower unnamed rank for plants these are now called varieties linnaeus groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics  only his groupings for animals survive and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception as have the principles behind them  nevertheless linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics  while the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid observable characteristics have changed with expanding knowledge for example dna sequencing unavailable in linnaeus time has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships the fundamental principle remains sound according to german biologist ernst haeckel the question of mans origin began with linnaeus he helped future research in the natural history of man by describing humans just like he described any other plant or animal  linnaeus was the first person to place humans in a system of biological classification he put humans under homo sapiens among the primates in the first edition of systema naturae during his time at hartecamp he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted several similarities between them and man he pointed out that both species basically have the same anatomy except for the speech he found no other differences  thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category antromorpha meaning manlike  this classification received criticism from other botanists such as johan gottschalk wallerius jacob theodor klein and johann georg gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe a human as like a man   in a letter to gmelin from 1747 linnaeus replied the theological concerns were twofold first that putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position man was assumed to have in the great chain of being and second because the bible says that man was created in the image of god if monkeysapes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of god as well  this was something many could not accept the conflict between worldviews based on science and theology that was caused by asserting that man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater and still ongoing creationevolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of on the origin of species by charles darwin in 1859 after this criticism linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly  in the 10th edition of systema naturae introduced new terms including mammalia and primate the latter which would replace antromorpha the new classification received less criticism but many natural historians still felt that human had been demoted from its former place to rule over nature not be a part of it but linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and thus should be there  in his book dieta naturalis he said one should not vent ones wrath on animals theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere aoutomata mechanica but i believe they would be better advise that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility linnaeus also added a second human species in systema naturae the homo troglodytes or caveman  this name was based on a figure and description by bontius from 1658 the figure referred to a female indonesian or malayan human and the description to an orang utan an example of this was that linnaeus did not only settle with trying to classify these mythical creatures but also tried to find out for example if the homo troglodytes actually existed by asking the swedish east indian trade company to search for one they did not however find any signs of its existence  broberg believes the new human species linnaeus described were actually monkeys or native people clad in skins to frighten settlers whose appearances had been exaggerated in transit to linnaeus in 1771 linn published another name for a nonhuman primate in the genus homo which was homo lar this name is currently in use for the lar gibbon as hylobates lar linn 1771 anniversaries of linnaeus birth especially in centennial years have been marked by major celebrations   in 1807 events were held in sweden that included linnaeus daughters and apostles such as afzelius who was then head of the shortlived linnska institutet a century later celebrations of the bicentennial expanded globally and were even larger in sweden at uppsala university honorary doctorates given to ernst haeckel francis darwin and selma lagerlf among others the memorials were so numerous that newspaper columnists began to tire of them and printed caricatures of the esteemed linnaeus in 1917 on the 210th anniversary of linnaeus birth the swedish linnaeus society was founded and proceeded to restore the linnaean garden which had fallen into disrepair   in 2007 tricentennial celebrations were held   during that year a documentary titled expedition linnaeus was produced which was intended to increase public understanding of and respect for nature the linnean society of london has awarded the linnean medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888  starting in 1978 in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of linnaeus the bicentenary medal of the linnean society has been awarded in recognition of work done by a biologist under the age of forty the royal botanic garden of edinburgh holds a monument to linnaeus near the hothouses it was designed by the noted scots architect robert adam in 1778  it has a portrait head in low relief set on an oval urn it was erected in 1779 by dr john hope 17251760 regius keeper of the garden it originally stood in the botanic garden on haddington place hope was the first to introduce the linnean system of classification to scotland the linnean society of new south wales awards a bursary to assist botany zoology or geology students at the university of sydney the australian national university campus has a road named linnaeus way which runs past several biology buildings gustavus adolphus college began its eponymous linnaeus arboretum in 1973 the asteroid 7412 linnaeus and linn crater on the earths moon were named in his honor the nightshade species solanum linnaeanum and twinflower genus linnaea were named in his honor linnaeus has appeared on numerous swedish postage stamps and banknotes following approval by the parliament of sweden vxj university and kalmar college merged on 1 january 2010 the resulting institution was named linnaeus university in his honor', 'computerscience the general public sometimes confuses computer science with careers that deal with computers such as information technology or think that it relates to their own experience of computers which typically involves activities such as gaming webbrowsing and wordprocessing  however the focus of computer science is more on understanding the properties of the programs used to implement software such as games and webbrowsers and using that understanding to create new programs or improve existing ones the early foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer  machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity  wilhelm schickard designed the first mechanical calculator in 1623 but did not complete its construction  blaise pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator the pascaline in 1642  charles babbage designed a difference engine in victorian times helped by ada lovelace around 1900 punchcard machines were introduced  however all of these machines were constrained to perform a single task or at best some subset of all possible tasks during the 1940s as newer and more powerful computing machines were developed the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors  as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general  computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s the first computer science degree program in the united states was formed at purdue university in 1962  since practical computers became available many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own right although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population it is the now wellknown ibm brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time  ibm short for international business machines released the ibm 704 and later the ibm 709 computers which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices  still working with the ibm computer was frustratingif you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction the program would crash and you would have to start the whole process over again time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computer science technology  modern society has seen a significant shift from computers being used solely by experts or professionals to a more widespread user base  initially computers were quite costly and for their mosteffective use some degree of human aid was needed in part by professional computer operators  however as computers became widespread and far more affordable less human assistance was needed although residues of the original assistance still remained despite its short history as a formal academic discipline computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society  these include as a discipline computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software csab formerly called computing sciences accreditation board  which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery acm and the ieee computer society ieeecs   identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science theory of computation algorithms and data structures programming methodology and languages and computer elements and architecture  in addition to these four areas csab also identifies fields such as software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking and communication database systems parallel computation distributed computation computerhuman interaction computer graphics operating systems and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science the broader field of theoretical computer science encompasses both the classical theory of computation and a wide range of other topics that focus on the more abstract logical and mathematical aspects of computing according to peter j denning the fundamental question underlying computer science is what can be efficiently automated  the study of the theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations  in an effort to answer the first question computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problem the famous pnp problem one of the millennium prize problems is an open problem in the theory of computation multiprocessing is running a system with more than one processor the theory is of course that you can double performance by using two processors instead of one  and the reality of course is that it doesnt work this well although multiprocessing can result in improved performance under certain conditions  in order to employ multiprocessing effectively the computer system must have all of the following in place computational science or scientific computing is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyse and solve scientific problems  in practical use it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines this branch of computer science aims to create synthetic systems which solve computational problems reason andor communicate like animals and humans do  this theoretical and applied subfield requires a very rigorous and integrated expertise in multiple subject areas such as applied mathematics logic semiotics electrical engineering philosophy of mind neurophysiology and social intelligence which can be used to advance the field of intelligence research or be applied to other subject areas which require computational understanding and modelling such as in finance or the physical sciences  this field started in full earnest when alan turing the pioneer of computer science and artificial intelligence proposed the turing test for the purpose of answering the ultimate question  can computers think the field of software systems encompasses a wide range of subfields which involve principled design and analysis of various kinds of software based systems  these fields use concepts and techniques from theoretical computer science artificial intelligence mathematics electrical engineering and so on to build software systems for various real world tasks following peter wegner amnon h eden proposes that there are three paradigms at work in various areas of computer science despite its name a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves  because of this several alternative names have been proposed  certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science to emphasize precisely that difference  danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment while not necessarily involving computers the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen founded in 1969 with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries  also in the early days of computing a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm  turingineer turologist flowchartsman applied metamathematician and applied epistemologist  three months later in the same journal comptologist was suggested followed next year by hypologist the term computics has also been suggested  in continental europe names such as informatique french informatik german or informatica dutch derived from information and possibly mathematics or automatic are more common than names derived from computercomputation the renowned computer scientist edsger dijkstra stated computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science  for example the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems  however there has been much crossfertilization of ideas between the various computerrelated disciplines  computer science research has also often crossed into other disciplines such as philosophy cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics statistics and economics computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science the relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue which is further muddied by disputes over what the term software engineering means and how computer science is defined  david parnas taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals making the two separate but complementary disciplines the academic political and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis  computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science  both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning  these programs often feature the theory of computation analysis of algorithms formal methods concurrency theory databases computer graphics and systems analysis among others they typically also teach computer programming but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of highlevel study other colleges and universities as well as secondary schools and vocational programs that teach computer science emphasize the practice of advanced programming rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula  such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry the practical aspects of computer programming are often referred to as software engineering  however there is a lot of disagreement over the meaning of the term and whether or not it is the same thing as programming', 'chervil a member of the apiaceae chervil is native to the caucasus but was spread by the romans through most of europe where it is now naturalised

of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions the current version was composed by ramn carnicer with words by eusebio lillo and has six parts plus the chorus the first chilean national anthem dates back to 1819 when the government called for on the 19th of july the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose the composer manuel robles and the poet bernardo de vera y pintado fulfilled this mandate and their national song debuted on the 20 august 1820 in the domingo arteaga theater although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of september 1819 in the beginning everyone would stand for the song  ohiggins and freire listened to it with respect and full of emotion for they had marched to victory to its tune more than once the custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared until it was ordered that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country the doctor bernardo vera known in the history of the independence was the author of the verses that were sung to robles music this first hymn was sung until 1828 when it was replaced with what is sung today the second chilean national anthem was

pinochet the verse iii was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police carabiners after that in 1990 it was eliminated from the anthem and only sung in

archaeological remains from this period include the wellpreserved neolithic village of choirokoitia also known as khirokitia which has been declared a world heritage site by unesco along with the tombs of the kings cyprus is home to some of the oldest water wells in the world and is the site of the earliest known example of feline domestication   as a strategic location in the middle east cyprus has been occupied by several major powers including the empires of the hittites assyrians egyptians persians rashiduns umayyads lusignans venetians and ottomans settled by mycenean greeks in the 2nd millennium bc the island also experienced long periods of greek rule under the ptolemies and the byzantines in 333 bc alexander the great took over the island from the persians the ottoman empire conquered the island in 1570 and it remained under ottoman control for over three centuries it was placed under british administration in 1878 until it was granted independence in 1960 becoming a member of the commonwealth the following year in 1974 following 11 years of intercommunal violence and an attempted coup dtat by greek cypriot nationalists turkey invaded and occupied the northern portion of the island the intercommunal violence and subsequent turkish invasion led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of cypriots and the establishment of a separate turkish cypriot political entity in the north  these events and the resulting political situation are matters of ongoing dispute the republic of cyprus has de jure sovereignty over the entire island of cyprus and its surrounding waters except small portions akrotiri and dhekelia that are allocated by treaty to the united kingdom as sovereign military bases the republic of cyprus is de facto partitioned into two main parts the area under the effective control of the republic of cyprus comprising about 59 of the islands area and the turkishoccupied area in the north calling itself the turkish republic of northern cyprus covering about 36 of the islands area and recognized only by turkey the etymology of the greek name kypros is unknown suggestions include the earliest attested reference to cyprus is the mycenaean greek kupirijo meaning cypriot written in linear b syllabic script through overseas trade the island has given its name to the classical latin word for copper through the phrase aes cyprium metal of cyprus later shortened to cuprum cyprus more specifically the shores of paphos was also one of the birthplaces of aphrodite given in greek mythology who was known as kupria since according to phoenician mythology astarte goddess of love and beauty who was later identified with the  aphrodite the standard demonym relating to cyprus or its people or culture is cypriot the terms cypriote and cyprian are also less frequently used the earliest confirmed site of human activity on cyprus is aetokremnos situated on the south coast indicating that huntergatherers were active on the island from around 10000 bc with settled village communities dating from 8200 bc the arrival of the first humans correlates with the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants remains of an 8monthold cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a separate neolithic site in cyprus the island was part of the hittite empire during the late bronze age until the arrival of two waves of greek settlement the first wave consisted of mycenaean greek traders who started visiting cyprus around 1400 bc  a major wave of greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the bronze age collapse of mycenaean greece in the period 11001050 bc with the islands predominantly greek character dating from this period  cyprus occupies an important role in greek mythology being the birthplace of aphrodite and adonis and home to king cinyras teucer and pygmalion beginning in the 8th century bc phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of cyprus near present day larnaca and salamis cyprus was ruled by assyria for a century starting in 708 bc before a brief spell under egyptian rule and eventually persian rule in 545 bc the island was brought under permanent greek rule by alexander the great and the ptolemies of egypt following his death   full hellenization took place during the ptolemaic period which ended when cyprus was annexed by the roman republic in 58 bc when the roman empire was divided into eastern and western parts in 395 cyprus became part of the east roman or byzantine empire and would remain part of it until the crusades some 800 years later   under byzantine rule the greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong hellenisticchristian character that continues to be a hallmark of the greek cypriot community no byzantine churches survive from this period thousands of people were killed and many cities  such as salamis  were destroyed and never rebuilt he used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the saracens a year later richard sold the island to the knights templar who following a bloody revolt in turn sold it to guy of lusignan his brother and successor amalric was recognized as king of cyprus by henry vi holy roman emperor following the death in 1473 of james ii the last lusignan king the republic of venice assumed control of the island while his venetian widow queen caterina cornaro reigned as figurehead   venice formally annexed cyprus in 1489 following the abdication of caterina during the almost four centuries of latin rule there existed two societies on cyprus the first consisted of frankish nobles and their retinue as well as italian merchants and their families the second the majority of the population consisted of greek cypriots serfs and laborers   although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture the effort failed in 1570 a full scale ottoman assault with 60000 troops brought the island under ottoman control despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of nicosia and famagusta 20000 nicosians were put to death and every church public building and palace was looted the previous latin elite was destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place when ottoman janissaries were settled on the island the ottomans abolished the feudal system previously in place and applied the millet system to cyprus under which nonmuslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities  in a reversal from the days of latin rule the head of the church of cyprus was invested as leader of the greek cypriot population and acted as mediator between christian greek cypriots and the ottoman authorities reaction to ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both greek and turkish cypriots although none were successful  by 1872 the population of the island had risen to 144000 comprising 44000 muslims and 100000 christians centuries of neglect by the turks the unrelenting poverty of most of the people and the everpresent tax collectors fuelled greek nationalism and by 19th century the idea of enosis or union with newly independent greece was firmly rooted among greek cypriots in the aftermath of the russoturkish war 18771878 administration but not sovereignty of the island was ceded to the british empire in 1878 in exchange for guarantees that britain would use the island as a base to protect the ottoman empire against possible russian aggression in 1915 britain offered cyprus to constantine i of greece on condition that greece join the war on the side of the british which he declined  in 1923 under the treaty of lausanne the nascent turkish republic relinquished any claim to cyprus and in 1925 it was declared a british crown colony during the second world war many enlisted in the cyprus regiment in january 1959 the church of cyprus organized a referendum which was boycotted by the turkish cypriot community where over 90 voted in favor of enosis meaning union with greece restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the british administration but eventually rejected  in 1955 the eoka organisation was founded seeking independence and union with greece through armed struggle  at the same time the tmt calling for taksim or partition was established by the turkish cypriots as a counterweight  turmoil on the island was met with force by the british on august 16 1960 cyprus attained independence after the zrich and london agreement between the united kingdom greece and turkey the uk retained the two sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas giving the minority turks a permanent veto 30 in parliament and administration and granting the 3 motherstates guarantor rights in 1963 intercommunal violence broke out partially sponsored by both motherlands with turkish cypriots being forced into enclaves and cypriot president archbishop makarios iii calling for unilateral constitutional changes as a means to ease tensions over the whole island the united nations was involved and the united nations forces in cyprus unficyp deployed at flash points in 1964 turkey attempted to intervene in  cyprus in response to the ongoing cypriot intercommunal violence but was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the us president lyndon b johnson on june 5 1964 who warned that the united states would not stand beside turkey in case of a consequential soviet invasion of turkish territory following a coup dtat engineered by the greek junta turkey launched a fullscale military invasion of the island in 1974  the turkish air force began bombing greek positions on cyprus hundreds of paratroops were dropped in the area between nicosia and kyrenia where wellarmed turkish cypriot enclaves had been longestablished while off the kyrenia coast 30 turkish troop ships protected by destroyers landed 6000 men as well as tanks trucks and armored vehicles three days later when a ceasefire had been agreed turkey had landed 30000 troops on the island and captured kyrenia the corridor linking kyrenia to nicosia and the turkishcypriot quarter of nicosia the junta in athens and then the sampson regime in cyprus fell from power  in nicosia glafkos clerides assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored ostensibly removing the pretext the turks gave for the invasion the turks used a period of negotiations to reinforce their kyrenia bridgehead and prepare for the second phase of the invasion which began on 14 august and resulted in the seizure of morphou karpasia ammochostos and the mesaoria the greek forces were unable to resist the turkish advance international pressure led to a ceasefire at which point 37 of the island had been taken over by the turks and 180000 greek cypriots were evicted from their homes in the north  at the same time around 50000 turkish cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the turkish forces and settled in the properties of the displaced greek cypriots in mid1975 the united states congress amongst a variety of sanctions against turkey imposed an arms embargo on turkey for using americansupplied equipment during the turkish invasion of cyprus in 1974 in 1983 turkish cypriots proclaimed the turkish republic of northern cyprus which is recognised only by turkey as of today there are 1534 greek cypriots and 502 turkish cypriots missing as a result of the fighting the events of the summer of 1974 dominate the politics on the island as well as grecoturkish relations  around 150000 settlers from turkey are believed to be living in the north in violation of the geneva convention and various un resolutions  following the invasion and the capture of its northern territory by turkish troops the republic of cyprus announced that all of its ports of entry in the north are closed as they are effectively not under its control the last major effort to settle the cyprus dispute was the annan plan it gained the support of the turkish cypriots but was rejected by the greek cypriots who perceived the annan plan to be both unbalanced and excessively proturkish in july 2006 the island served as a safe haven for people fleeing lebanon because of the conflict between israel and hezbollah in march 2008 a wall that for decades had stood at the boundary between the greek cypriot controlled side and the un buffer zone was demolished the wall had cut across ledra street in the heart of nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the islands 32year division  on 3 april 2008 ledra street was reopened in the presence of greek and turkish cypriot officials cyprus is the third largest island in the mediterranean after the italian islands of sicily and sardinia and the worlds 81st largest it measures 240 kilometers long from end to end and 100km wide at its widest point with turkey 75km to the north  other neighbouring territories include syria and lebanon to the east 105km and 108km respectively israel 200km to the southeast egypt 380km to the south and greece to the northwest 280km to the small dodecanesian island of kastellrizo meysti 400km to rhodes and 800km to the greek mainland the physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges the troodos mountains and the smaller kyrenia range and the central plain they encompass the mesaoria the troodos mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area the highest point on cyprus is mount olympus at convert1952 located in the center of the troodos range the narrow kyrenia range extending along the northern coastline occupies substantially less area and elevations are lower reaching a maximum of convert1024 geopolitically the island is subdivided into four main segments the republic of cyprus the internationally recognized government occupies the southern twothirds of the island 5974   the turkish republic of northern cyprus occupies the northern third 3485 of the island and is recognized only by turkey as it consists of the turkishoccupied areas the united nationscontrolled green line is a buffer zone that separates the two and covers 267 of the island   lastly two bases under british sovereignty are located on the island  akrotiri and dhekelia covering the remaining 274 one of the unique features of cyprus habitats is the wild and sharp differences in elevations and habitats in different parts of the island as well as different climate conditions all of which supply a diverse habitat for a unique array of fauna and flora the number of plant species and subspecies of wild plant in cyprus is possibly in the thousands many of them being endemic  wildlife can be seen in troodos mountains larnaca salt lake akrotiri salt lake and undoubtedly akamas national park cyprus is home to cyprus moufflon which is a national symbol of the country  moufflon is protected and can be seen in paphos forests towards branches of troodos mountain cyprus has a subtropical climate  mediterranean and semiarid type in the northeastern part of island  according to kppen climate classification signes csa and bsh with very mild winters on the coast and warm to hot summers  snow is possible only in the troodos mountains in the central part of island  rain occurs mainly in winter with summer being generally dry  also coastal of cyprus is one of the few places in europe which are green all year round cyprus has the warmest climate and warmest winters in the mediterranean part of the european union the average annual temperature on the coast is around convert24 during the day and convert14 at night  generally  summersholiday season lasts about 8 months begins in april with average temperatures of convert21 during the day and convert11 at night ends in november with average temperatures of convert22 during the day and convert12 at night although also in remaining 4

depending on the location  in total 7 months  from may to november  the average sea temperature exceeds convert20 sunshine hours on the coast is around 3400 per year from average 56 hours of sunshine  day in december to average 1213 hours in july cyprus is suffering from an ongoing shortage of water the country relies heavily on rain to provide household water and for many years now the average annual rainfall seemed to be falling  between 2001 and 2004 exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up with supply exceeding demand allowing total storage in the islands reservoirs to rise to an all time high by the start of 2005 however since then demand has increased annually  a result of local population growth foreigners relocating to cyprus and the number of visiting tourists  while supply has fallen  cyprus has a total of 108 dams and reservoirs with a total water storage capacity of about 330000000 m3  dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use  water desalination plants are gradually being constructed in order to deal with recent years of prolonged drought the government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 percent of domestic water since 2001  efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity cyprus is a presidential republic the head of state and of the government is elected by a process of universal suffrage for a fiveyear term  executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the house of representatives whilst the judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature the 1960 constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted powersharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the turkish cypriots the executive was led by a greek cypriot president and a turkish cypriot vice president elected by their respective communities for fiveyear terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions  legislative power rested on the house of representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters rolls following clashes between the two communities the turkish cypriot seats in the house remain vacant since 1965  turkish cypriots refused to establish the state of affairs before the invasion of cyprus as is evident in the secretarygeneral of the united nations who said the turkish cypriot leaders have adhered to a rigid stand against any measures which might involve having members of the two communities live and work together or which might place turkish cypriots in situations where they would have to acknowledge the authority of government agents  indeed since the turkish cypriot leadership is committed to physical and geographical separation of the communities as a political goal it is not likely to encourage activities by turkish cypriots which may be interpreted as demonstrating the merits of an alternative policy the result has been a seemingly deliberate policy of selfsegregation by the turkish cypriots by 1974 the two communities had returned to a more tolerant state of living in 1974 cyprus was divided de facto into the greek cypriot controlled southern twothirds of the island and the turkish controlled northern third the turkish cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the turkish republic of northern cyprus but were recognized only by turkey in 1985 the trnc adopted a constitution and held its first elections the united nations recognises the sovereignty of the republic of cyprus over the entire island of cyprus the house of representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five year term 56 members by proportional representation and 3 observer members representing the armenian latin and maronite minorities 24 seats are allocated to the turkish community but remain vacant since 1964  the political environment is dominated by the communist akel the liberal conservative democratic rally the centrist democratic party the socialdemocratic edek and the centrist euroko on 17 february 2008 dimitris christofias of the akel was elected president of cyprus on akels first electoral victory without being part of a wider coalition  cyprus is currently one of only two countries in the world to have a democratically elected communist government the other being nepal and the only european union member state under communist leadership  christofias took over government from tassos papadopoulos of the democratic party who had been in office since february 2003 the republic of cyprus is divided into six districts  nicosia famagusta kyrenia larnaca limassol and paphos cyprus has four exclaves all in territory that belongs to the british sovereign base area of dhekelia the first two are the villages of ormidhia and xylotymvou the third is the dhekelia power station which is divided by a british road into two parts the northern part is an exclave like the two villages whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an exclave although it has no territorial waters of its own the un buffer zone runs up against dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off ayios nikolaos and is connected to the rest of dhekelia by a thin land corridor  in that sense the buffer zone turns the paralimni  area on the southeast corner of the island into a de facto though not de jure exclave the island nation cyprus is member of  australia

for its highly developed infrastructure economic policy of the cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the european union the cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 january 2008 oil has recently been discovered in the seabed between cyprus and egypt and talks are underway between lebanon and egypt to reach an agreement regarding the exploration of these resources the seabed separating lebanon and cyprus is believed to hold significant quantities of crude oil and natural gas the economy of the turkishoccupied areas operates on a freemarket basis although it continues to be handicapped by the lack of private and public investment high freight costs and shortages of skilled labor  despite these constraints the economy turned in an impressive performance in 2003 and 2004 with growth rates of 96 and 114  the average income in the area was 15984 s16289 in 2008  growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the turkish new lira and by a boom in the education and construction sectors the island has witnessed a massive growth in tourism over the years and as such the property rental market in cyprus has grown alongside added to this is the capital growth in property that has been created from the demand of incoming investors and property buyers to the island in cyprus the euro was introduced in 2008  three different designs were selected for the cypriot coins the designs were chosen from entrants in a competition in 2005 the 2 s259 coin is a legacy of an old national practice of minting silver and  gold commemorative coins to commemorate this event a 5 s648 collector coin was also issued  unlike normal issues these coins are not legal tender in all of the eurozone and so cannot be used in any other

larnaca international airport and paphos international airport nicosia international airport has been closed since 1974 and although ercan airport was still in use it was only for flights from turkey public transport in cyprus is limited to privately run bus services except in nicosia taxis and interurban shared taxi services referred to locally as service taxis  per capita private car ownership is the 5th highest in the world  in 2006 extensive plans were announced to improve and expand bus services and restructure public transport throughout cyprus with the financial backing of the european union development bank the main harbours of the island are limassol harbour and larnaca harbour which service cargo passenger and cruise ships cyta the stateowned telecommunications company manages most telecommunications and internet connections on the island  however following the recent liberalisation of the sector a few private telecommunications companies have emerged including mtn cablenet telepassport otenet telecom omega telecom and primetel in the turkishcontrolled area of cyprus three companies are also present  these are turkcell vodafone and turk telekom according to the first population census after the declaration of independence carried out in december 1960 and covering the entire island cyprus had a total population of 573566 with ethnic greeks comprising 77 of the islands population and ethnic turks 18 other nationals accounted for the remaining 5   according to the last census covering the entire island april 1973 the population of cyprus was 631778 with the ethnic turkish community estimated at 19 of the total about 120000 the latest available estimates by the republic of cyprus statistical service put the islands population at the end of 2006 at 867600

members wear black uniforms and whose literature is being investigated for violating antiracism laws the country has two official languages  greek and turkish cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education the high quality of instruction can be attributed to a large extent to the aboveaverage competence of the teachers but also to the fact that nearly 7 of the gdp is spent on education which makes cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the eu along with denmark and sweden state schools are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to privatesector institutions  however the value of a state highschool diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25 of the final grade for each topic with the remaining 75 assigned by the teacher during the semester in a minimally transparent way  cypriot universities like universities in greece ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes  while a highschool diploma is mandatory for university attendance admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take the majority of cypriots receive their higher education at greek britishturkish other european and north american universities it is noteworthy that cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of working age who have higherlevel education in the eu at 30 which is ahead of finlands 295  in addition 47 of its population aged 2534 have tertiary education which is the highest in the eu the body of cypriot students is highly mobile with 787 studying in a university outside cyprus the art history of cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10000 years following the discovery of a series of chalcolithic period carved figures in the villages of khoirokoitia and lempa and the island is also the home to numerous examples of high quality religious icon painting from the middle ages cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by french gothic and italian renaissance introduced in the island during the era of latin domination 11911571 in modern times cypriot art history begins with the painter vassilis vryonides 18831958 who studied at the academy of fine arts in venice arguably the two founding fathers of modern cypriot art were adamantios diamantis 19001994 who studied at londons royal college of art and christopheros savva 19241968 who also studied in london at st martins school of art in many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day  in particular the majority of cypriot artists still train in england although art schools in greece are also popular and local art institutions such as the cyprus college of art university of nicosia and the frederick institute of technology are becoming more popular one of the features of cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although conceptual art is being rigorously promoted by a number of art institutions and most notably the nicosia municipal art centre httpwwwnimaccomcy  municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene  cyprus was due to host the international art festival manifesta in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the dutch organizers of manifesta and the cyprus ministry of education and culture over the location of some of the manifesta events in the turkish sector of the capital nicosia  other notable cypriot artists include rhea bailey mihail kkasialos ioannis kissonergis theodoulos gregoriou helene black george skoteinos kalopedis family nicos nicolaides stass paraskos arests stas telemachos kanthos konstantia sofokleous and chris achilleos the traditional folk music of cyprus has several common elements with greek turkish and arabic music including grecoturkish dances such as the sousta syrtos zeibekikos tatsia and kartsilamas as well as the middle easterninspired tsifteteli and arapie  there is also a form of musical poetry known as chattista which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations the instruments commonly associated with cyprus folk music are the bouzouki pictured oud outi violin fkiolin lute laouto accordion cyprus flute pithkiavlin and percussion including the toumperleki  composers associated with traditional cypriot music include evagoras karageorgis marios tokas solon michaelides and savvas salides popular music in cyprus is generally influenced by the greek laka scene with several artists including anna vissi evridiki and sarbel earning widespread popularity in cyprus greece and parts of the middle east hip hop rb and reggae are also very popular genres on the island and have been supported by the emergence of cypriot rap and the urban music scene at ayia napa cypriot rock music and ntekhno rock is often associated with artists such as michalis hatzigiannis and alkinoos ioannidis metal also has a small following in cyprus represented by bands such as winters verge and quadraphonic literary production of the antiquity includes the cypria an epic poem probably composed in the late seventh century bc and attributed to stasinus the cypria is one of the very first specimens of greek and european poetry the cypriot zeno of citium was the founder of the stoic philosophy epic poetry notably the acritic songs flourished during middle ages two chronicles one written by leontios machairas and the other by voustronios refer to the period under french domination 15th century  pomes damour written in medieval greek cypriot date back from 16th century some of them are actual translations of poems written by petrarch bembo ariosto and g sannazzaro hasan hilmi efendi a turkish cypriot poet was rewarded by the ottoman sultan mahmud ii and said to be the sultan of the poems modern literary figures from cyprus include the poet and writer kostas montis poet kyriakos charalambides poet michalis pasiardis writer nicos nicolaides stylianos atteshlis altheides loukis akritas and demetris th gotsis dimitris lipertis vasilis michaelides and pavlos liasides are folk poets who wrote poems mainly in the cypriotgreek dialect  lawrence durrell lived in northern cyprus from 1952 until 26 august 1956 and wrote the book bitter lemons concerning his time there which won the second duff cooper prize in 1957   the majority of the play othello by william shakespeare is set on the island of cyprus cyprus also figures in religious literature such as the acts of the apostles according to which the apostles barnabas and paul preached on the island halloumi cheese originated in cyprus and was initially made during the medieval byzantine period subsequently gaining popularity throughout the middleeast halloumi hellim is commonly served sliced either fresh or grilled as an appetiser seafood and fish dishes of cyprus include squid octopus red mullet and sea bass  cucumber and tomato are used widely in salads  common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley pickled cauliflower and beets asparagus and taro other traditional delicacies of the island are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine and eventually dried and smoked such as lountza smoked pork loin charcoalgrilled lamb souvlaki pork and chicken cooked over charcoal and sheftalia minced meat wrapped in mesentery  pourgouri bulgur cracked wheat is the traditional carbohydrate other than bread and is used to make the cypriot delicacy koubes fresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients in cypriot cuisine  frequently used vegetables include courgettes green peppers okra green beans artichokes carrots tomatoes cucumbers lettuce and grape leaves and pulses such as beans broad beans peas blackeyed beans chickpeas and lentils the commonest among fruits and nuts are pears apples grapes oranges mandarines nectarines mespila blackberries cherry strawberries figs watermelon melon avocado lemon pistachio almond chestnut walnut hazelnut cyprus is also wellknown for its desserts including lokum also known as turkish delight this island has protected geographical indication pgi for its lokum produced in the village of geroskipou governing bodies of sports in cyprus include the cyprus football association cyprus basketball federation cyprus volleyball federation cyprus automobile association cyprus badminton federation cyprus cricket association and the cyprus rugby federation football is by far the most popular spectator sport  there have been many accomplishments on the european scale by several teams but most importantly the entrance in the uefa champions league group stage as firstly achieved in 2008 by anorthosis famagusta fc and apoel fc in 2009 the cyprus league is nowadays considered as quite competitive and includes notable teams such as  aek larnaca fc nea salamis famagusta fc ac omonia apollon fc and ael lemesos stadiums or sports venues in cyprus include the gsp stadium the largest in cyprus antonis papadopoulos stadium ammochostos stadium neo gsz stadium tsirion stadium and makario stadium cyprus also has a football national team which in the last decade has evolved to a promising squad within the european rankings apart from the main interest in football cyprus has exhibited certain accomplishments in other sports  marcos baghdatis is one of the most successful tennis players in international stage he was a finalist at the australian open in 2006 and reached the wimbledon semifinal in the same year   also kyriakos ioannou a cypriot high jumper achieved a jump of 235m at the 11th iaaf world championships in athletics held in osaka japan in 2007 winning the bronze medal newspapers include

sites and several other monasteries of which the kykkos monastery is the richest and most famous the churches are the area has been known since ancient times for its copper mines and in the byzantine period it became a great centre of byzantine art as churches and monasteries were built in the mountains away from the threatened coastline three prominent ancient mosques in cyprus', 'consciousness consciousness in medicine eg anesthesiology is assessed by observing a patients alertness and responsiveness and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from alert oriented to time and place and communicative through disorientation then delirium then loss of any meaningful communication and ending with loss of movement in response to painful stimulation consciousness in psychology and philosophy typically means something beyond what it means for anesthesiology and may be said in many contexts to imply four characteristics subjectivity change continuity and selectivity  philosopher franz brentano has suggested intentionality or aboutness that consciousness is about something  however within the philosophy of mind there is no consensus on whether intentionality is a requirement for consciousness consciousness is the subject of much research in philosophy of mind psychology neuroscience cognitive science cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence  issues of practical concern include how the presence of consciousness can be assessed in severely ill or comatose people whether nonhuman consciousness exists and if so how it can be measured at what point in fetal development consciousness begins and whether computers can achieve a conscious state the word conscious is derived from latin conscius meaning 1 having joint or common knowledge with another privy to cognizant of 2 conscious to oneself esp conscious of guilt a related word was conscientia which primarily means moral conscience  in the literal sense conscientia means knowledgewith that is shared knowledge the word first appears in latin juridical texts by writers such as cicero here conscientia is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else ren descartes 15961650 is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way that does not seem to fit this traditional meaning  descartes used conscientia the way modern speakers would use conscience  in search after truth he says conscience or internal testimony conscientia vel interno testimonio shortly thereafter in britain the neoplatonist theologian ralph cudworth used the modern meaning of consciousness in his true intellectual system of the universe 1678 and associated the concept with personal identity which is assured by the repeated consciousness of oneself  cudworths use of the term also remained intertwined with moral agency  while there were no elaborate theories of consciousness in the seventeenth century there was an awareness of the idea of consciousness  cudworth was the first english philosopher to make extensive use of the noun consciousness with a specific philosophical meaning twelve years later locke in essay concerning human understanding 1690 connected consciousness with personal identity  locke argued that being the same person from one time to another was not dependent upon having the same soul or same body but instead the same consciousness  locke defined consciousness as the perception of what passes in a mans own mind  locke had much influence on the 18th century view of consciousness in samuel johnsons celebrated dictionary 1755 johnson uses this definition of consciousness there are many philosophical stances on consciousness including behaviorism dualism idealism functionalism reflexive monism phenomenalism phenomenology and intentionality physicalism emergentism mysticism personal identity and externalism phenomenal consciousness pconsciousness is simply experience it is moving colored forms sounds sensations emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center  these experiences considered independently of any impact on behavior are called qualia the hard problem of consciousness formulated by david chalmers in 1996 deals with the issue of how to explain a state of phenomenal consciousness in terms of its neurological basis eccles and others have pointed out the difficulty of explaining the evolution of qualia or of minds which experience them given that all the processes governing evolution are physical and so have no direct access to them  there is no guarantee that all people have minds nor any way to verify whether one does or does not possess one events that occur in the mind or brain that are not within phenomenal or access consciousness are known as subconscious events for centuries philosophers have investigated phenomenal consciousness  ren descartes who coined the famous dictum cogito ergo sum wrote meditations on first philosophy in the seventeenth century  according to descartes all thought is conscious  conscious experience according to descartes included such ideas as imaginings and perceptions laid out in space and time that are viewed from a point and appearing as a result of some quality such as color smell and so on  modern readers are often confused by this descartes notion of interchangeability between the terms idea and imaginings descartes defines ideas as extended things as in this excerpt from his treatise on man thus descartes does not identify mental ideas with activity within the sense organs or even with brain activity but rather with the forms or images that unite the body and the rational soul through the mediating gland h this organ is now known as the pineal gland  descartes notes that anatomically while the human brain consists of two symmetrical hemispheres the pineal gland which lies close to the brains centre appears to be singular   thus he extrapolated from this that it was the mediator between body and soul philosophical responses including those of nicolas malebranche thomas reid john locke david hume and immanuel kant were varied   malebranche for example agreed with descartes that the human being was composed of two elements body and mind and that conscious experience resided in the latter he did however disagree with descartes as to the ease with which we might become aware of our mental constitution stating i am not my own light unto myself   david hume and immanuel kant also differ from descartes in that they avoid mentioning a place from which experience is viewed certainly few if any modern philosophers have identified the pineal gland as the seat of dualist interaction when we look around a room or have a dream things are laid out in space and time and viewed as if from a point  however when philosophers and scientists consider the location of the form and contents of this phenomenal consciousness there are fierce disagreements  as an example descartes proposed that the contents are brain activity seen by a nonphysical place without extension the res cogitans which in meditations on first philosophy he identified as the soul  this idea is known as cartesian dualism another example is found in the work of thomas reid who thought the contents of consciousness are the world itself which becomes conscious experience in some way  this concept is a type of direct realism the precise physical substrate of conscious experience in the world such as photons quantum fields etc is usually not specified other philosophers such as george berkeley have proposed that the contents of consciousness are an aspect of minds and do not necessarily involve matter at all  this is a type of idealism yet others such as leibniz have considered that each point in the universe is endowed with conscious content  this is a form of panpsychism panpsychism is the belief that all matter including rocks for example is sentient or conscious the concept of the things in conscious experience being impressions in the brain is a type of representationalism and representationalism is a form of indirect realism it is sometimes held that consciousness emerges from the complexity of brain processing the general label emergence applies to new phenomena that emerge from a physical basis without the connection between the two explicitly specified some theorists hold that phenomenal consciousness poses an explanatory gap  colin mcginn takes the new mysterianism position that it cant be solved and chalmers criticizes purely physical accounts of mental experiences based on the idea that philosophical zombies are logically possible and supports property dualism but others have proposed speculative scientific theories to explain the explanatory gap such as quantum mind spacetime theories of consciousness reflexive monism and electromagnetic theories of consciousness to explain the correspondence between brain activity and experience parapsychologists and some philosophers eg  stephen braude sometimes appeal to the concepts of psychokinesis or telepathy to support the belief that consciousness is not confined to the brain lockes forensic notion of personal identity founded on an individual conscious subject would be criticized in the 19th century by marx nietzsche and freud following different angles  martin heideggers concept of the dasein beingthere would also be an attempt to think beyond the conscious subject marx considered that social relations ontologically preceded individual consciousness and criticized the conception of a conscious subject as an ideological conception on which liberal political thought was founded  marx in particular criticized the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen considering that the socalled individual natural rights were ideological fictions camouflaging social inequality in the attribution of those rights  later louis althusser would criticize the bourgeois ideology of the subject through the concept of interpellation hey you nietzsche for his part once wrote that they give you free will only to later blame yourself thus reversing the classical liberal conception of free will in a critical account of the genealogy of consciousness as the effect of guilt and ressentiment which he described in on the genealogy of morals hence nietzsche was the first one to make the claim that the modern notion of consciousness was indebted to the modern system of penalty which judged a man according to his responsibility that is by the consciousness through which acts can be attributed to an individual subject  i did this  this is me  consciousness is thus related by nietzsche to the classic philosopheme of recognition which according to him defines knowledge according to pierre klossowski 1969 nietzsche considered consciousness to be a hypostatization of the body composed of multiple forces the will to power according to him the subject was only a grammatical fiction we believed in the existence of an individual subject and therefore of a specific author of each act insofar as we speak  therefore the conscious subject is dependent on the existence of language a claim that would be generalized by critical discourse analysis see for example judith butler michel foucaults analysis of the creation of the individual subject through disciplines in discipline and punish 1975 would extend nietzsches genealogy of consciousness and personal identity  ie individualism  to the change in the juridicopenal system the emergence of penology and the disciplinization of the individual subject through the creation of a penal system that judged not the acts as it alleged to but the personal identity of the wrongdoer  in other words foucault maintained that by judging not the acts the crime but the person behind those acts the criminal the modern penal system was not only following the philosophical definition of consciousness once again demonstrating the imbrications between ideas and social institutions material ideology as althusser would call it it was by itself creating the individual person categorizing and dividing the masses into a category of poor but honest and lawabiding citizens and another category of professional criminals or recidivists gilbert ryle has argued that traditional understandings of consciousness depend on a cartesian outlook that divides into mind and body mind and world he proposed that we speak not of minds bodies and the world but of individuals or persons acting in the world  thus by saying consciousness we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings the failure to produce a workable definition of consciousness also raises formidable philosophical questions it has been argued that when antonio damasio defines consciousness as an organisms awareness of its own self and its surroundings the definition has not escaped circularity because awareness in that context can be considered a synonym for consciousness the notion of consciousness as passive awareness can be contrasted with the notion of the active construction of mental representations  maturana and varela showed that the brain is massively involved with creating worlds of experience for us with meager input from the senses  evolutionary biologist richard dawkins sums up the interactive view of experience  in a way what sense organs do is assist our brains to construct a useful model and it is this model that we move around in it is a kind of virtual reality simulation of the world because humans express their conscious states using language it is tempting to equate language abilities and consciousness  there are however speechless humans infants feral children aphasics severe forms of autism to whom consciousness is attributed despite language lost or not yet acquired  moreover the study of brain states of nonlinguistic primates in particular the macaques has been used extensively by scientists and philosophers in their quest for the neural correlates of the contents of consciousness julian jaynes argued to the contrary in the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind that for consciousness to arise in a person language needs to have reached a fairly high level of complexity  according to jaynes human consciousness emerged as recently as 1300 bce or thereabouts he defines consciousness in such a way as to show how he conceives of it as a type of thinking that builds upon non human ways of perceiving for example p55 some philosophers including wv quine and some neuroscientists including christof koch contest this hypothesis arguing that it suggests that prior to this discovery of consciousness experience simply did not exist   ned block argued that jaynes had confused consciousness with the concept of consciousness the latter being what was discovered between the iliad and the odyssey  daniel dennett points out that these approaches misconceive jayness definition of consciousness as more than mere perception or awareness of an object he notes that consciousness is like money in that having the thing requires having the concept of it so it is a revolutionary proposal and not a ridiculous error to suppose that consciousness only emerges when its concept does more recently merlin donald seeing a similar connection between language and consciousness and a similar link to cultural and not purely genetic evolution has put a similar proposal to jaynes forward  though relying on less specific speculation about the more recent prehistory of consciousness he writes he argues that an earlier symbol using culture must have preceded both the personal symbol using of individual consciousness as well as language itself the idea that language and consciousness are not innate to humans a characteristic of human nature but rather the result of cultural evolution beginning with something similar to the culture of chimpanzees goes back before darwin to rousseaus second discourse according to vedanta awareness is not a product of physical processes and can be considered under four aspects the first is waking consciousness jagaritasthana the identification with i or me in relationship with phenomenal experiences with external objects the second aspect is dream consciousness svapnasthana which embodies the same subjectobject duality as the waking state the third aspect of consciousness is deep sleep susupti which is nondual as a result of holding in abeyance all feelings thoughts and sensations the final aspect is the consciousness that underlies and transcends the first three aspects turiya also referred to as a transcognitive state anubhava or a state of selfrealization or freedom from bodymind identification moksha  gaudiya vedanta recognizes a fifth aspect of consciousness in which god becomes subordinate to bhakti in buddhism consciousness via is included in the five classically defined experiential aggregates the aggregates are seen as empty of selfnature that is they arise dependent on causes and conditions the cause for consciousness arising via is the arising of another  aggregate physical or mental and consciousness arising in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental nma aggregates the causation chain identified in the aggregate khandha model overlaps the conditioning chain in dependent origination paticcasamuppda model   consciousness is the third link between mind body mental formations and name  form in the traditional twelve causes nidna of dependent origination the six classes of consciousness are eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness intellectconsciousness  for a long time in scientific psychology consciousness as a research topic or explanatory concept was strongly discouraged by mainstream scholars because of concerns about the validation of primary data  research on topics associated with consciousness were conducted under the banner of attention  modern investigations into consciousness are based on psychological statistical studies and case studies of consciousness states and the deficits caused by lesions stroke injury or surgery that disrupt the normal functioning of human senses and cognition  these discoveries suggest that the mind is a complex structure derived from various localized functions that are bound together with a unitary awareness several studies point to common mechanisms in different clinical conditions that lead to loss of consciousness  persistent vegetative state pvs is a condition in which an individual loses the higher cerebral powers of the brain but maintains sleepwake cycles with full or partial autonomic functions  studies comparing pvs with healthy awake subjects consistently demonstrate an impaired connectivity between the deeper brainstem and thalamic and the upper cortical areas of the brain  in addition it is agreed that the general brain activity in the cortex is lower in the pvs state some electroneurobiological interpretations of consciousness characterize this loss of consciousness as a loss of the ability to resolve time similar to playing an old phonographic record at very slow or very rapid speed along a continuum that starts with inattention continues on sleep and arrives to coma and death the mit press cambridge mass 1st edition 2007   it is likely that different components of consciousness can be teased apart with anesthetics sedatives and hypnotics   these drugs appear to differentially act on several brain areas to disrupt to varying degrees different components of consciousness the ability to recall information for example may be disrupted by anesthetics acting on the hippocampal cortex   neurons in this region are particularly sensitive to anesthetics at the time loss of recall occurs   direct anesthetic actions on hippocampal neurons have been shown to underlie eeg effects that occur in humans and animals during loss of recall brain chemistry affects human consciousness  sleeping drugs such as midazolam  dormicum can bring the brain from the awake condition conscious to the sleep unconscious  wakeup drugs such as flumazenil reverse this process  many other drugs such as alcohol nicotine tetrahydrocannabinol thc heroin cocaine lsd mdma caffeine have a consciousnesschanging effect the bilateral removal of the centromedian nucleus part of the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus appears to abolish consciousness causing coma pvs severe mutism and other features that mimic brain death the centromedian nucleus is also one of the principal sites of action of general anaesthetics and antipsychotic drugs  this evidence suggests that a functioning thalamus is necessary but not sufficient for human consciousness neurophysiological studies in awake behaving monkeys point to advanced cortical areas in prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes as carriers of neuronal correlates of consciousness  christof koch and francis crick argue that neuronal mechanisms of consciousness are intricately related to prefrontal cortex  cortical areas involved in higher cognitive function affect behavioral control and planning  rodolfo llinas proposes that consciousness results from recurrent thalamocortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems content and the nonspecific centromedial thalamus thalamocortical systems context interact in the gamma band frequency via time coincidence  according to this view the i represents a global predictive function required for intentionality   experimental work of steven wise mikhail lebedev and their colleagues supports this view they demonstrated that activity of prefrontal cortex neurons reflects illusory perceptions of movements of visual stimuli  nikos logothetis and colleagues made similar observations on visually responsive neurons in the temporal lobe  these neurons reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes ie bistable percepts during binocular rivalry the studies of blindsight  vision without awareness after lesions to parts of the visual system such as the primary visual cortex  performed by lawrence weiskrantz and david p carey provided important insights on how conscious perception arises in the brain  an alternative and more global approach to analyzing neurophysiological electromagnetic correlates of consciousness is referred to by andrew and alexander fingelkurts as operational architectonics this stilluntested theory postulates that phenomenal patternsobjectsthoughts are matched with and generated by underlying neurophysiological activitys spatialtemporal patterns indexed as operational modules of different complexity that can be revealed directly from eeg the neuroscience of free will also seems to provide relevant insights to the understanding of consciousness a new approach has attempted to combine the methodologies of cognitive psychology and traditional philosophy to understand consciousness  this research has taken place in the new field called experimental philosophy which seeks to use empirical methods like conducting experiments to test how ordinary nonexperts think to inform the philosophical discussion the aim of this type of philosophical research on consciousness has been to try to get a better grasp on how exactly people ordinarily understand consciousness  for instance work by joshua knobe and jesse prinz suggests that people may have two different ways of understanding minds generally and another suggestion has been that there is actually no such phenomenon as consciousness  further justin sytsma and edouard machery have written about the proper methodology for studying folk intuitions about consciousness consciousness can be viewed from the standpoints of evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology approach as an adaptation because it is a trait that increases fitness  consciousness also adheres to john alcocks theory of animal behavioral adaptations because it possesses both proximate and ultimate causes the proximate causes for consciousness ie how consciousness evolved in animals is a subject considered by sir john c eccles in his paper evolution of consciousness he argues that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness  budiansky by contrast limits consciousness to humans proposing that human consciousness may have evolved as an adaptation to anticipate and counter social strategems of other humans predators and prey  alternatively it has been argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive having evolved initially in premammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social and natural environments by providing an energysaving neutral gear in an otherwise energyexpensive motor output machine   another theory proposed by shaun nichols and todd grantham proposes that it is unnecessary to trace the exact evolutionary or causal role of phenomenal consciousness because the complexity of phenomenal consciousness alone implies that it is an adaptation  once in place this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms as outlined by bernard j baars konrad lorenz sees the roots of consciousness in the process of selfexploration of an organism that sees itself acting and learns a lifetime  behind the mirror a search for a natural history of human knowledge since the dawn of newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that even consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms the first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was julien offray de la mettrie in his book lhomme machine man as machine the most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience  theories proposed by neuroscientists such as gerald edelman and antnio damsio and by philosophers such as daniel dennett seek to explain access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain  many other neuroscientists such as christof koch have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame allencompassing global theories  at the same time computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness some theoristsmost of whom are physicistshave argued that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness but that quantum theory provides the missing ingredients the most notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of karl h pribram and david bohm and the orchor theory formulated by stuart hameroff and roger penrose some of these qm theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness as well as qm interpretations of access consciousness  none of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment and many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing many of us attribute consciousness to higherorder animals such as dolphins and primates academic research is investigating the extent to which animals are conscious  this suggests the hypothesis that consciousness has coevolved with life which would require it to have some sort of added value especially survival value  people have therefore looked for specific functions and benefits of consciousness  many psychologists such as radical behaviorists and many philosophers such as those that support ryles approach would maintain that behavior can be explained by nonconscious processes akin to artificial intelligence and consider consciousness to be epiphenomenal or only weakly related to function regarding the primary function of conscious processing a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and informationprocessing that would otherwise be independent see review in baars 2002  this has been called the integration consensus  however it remained unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness  obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously eg neural activity related to vegetative functions reflexes unconscious motor programs lowlevel perceptual analyses etc and many kinds can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect cf morsella 2005 ervin lszl argues that selfawareness the ability to make observations of oneself evolved mile durkheim formulated the concept of so called collective consciousness which is essential for organization of human social relations the accelerating drive of human race to explorations cognition understanding and technological progress can be explained by some features of collective consciousness collective self  concepts and collective intelligence as there is no clear definition of consciousness and no empirical measure exists to test for its presence it has been argued that due to the nature of the problem of consciousness empirical tests are intrinsically impossible   however several tests have been developed that attempt an operational definition of consciousness and try to determine whether computers and nonhuman animals can demonstrate through behavior by passing these tests that they are conscious in medicine several neurological and brain imaging techniques like eeg and fmri have proven useful for physical measures of brain activity associated with consciousness   this is particularly true for eeg measures during anesthesia that can provide an indication of anesthetic depth although with still limited accuracies of  70  and a high degree of patient and drug variability seen though often thought of as a test for consciousness the turing test named after computer scientist alan turing who first proposed it is actually a test to determine whether or not a computer satisfied his operational definition of intelligent which is not synonymous with consciousness and selfawareness  this test is commonly cited in discussion of artificial intelligence the essence of the test is based on the imitation game in which a human experimenter attempts to converse via computer keyboards with two others   one of the others is a human who it is assumed is conscious while the other is a computer   because all of the conversation is via keyboards teletypes in turings original conception no cues such as voice prosody or appearance will be available to indicate which is human and which is the computer if the human is unable to determine which of the conversants is human and which is a computer the computer is said to have passed the turing test satisfied turings operational definition of intelligent the turing test has generated a great deal of research and philosophical debate  for example daniel dennett and douglas hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the turing test is necessarily conscious while david chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test yet fail to be conscious it has been argued that the question itself is excessively anthropomorphic   edsger dijkstra commented that the question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim expressing the view that different words are appropriate for the workings of a machine to those of animals even if they produce similar results just as submarines are not normally said to swim philosopher john searle developed a thought experiment the chinese room argument which is intended to show problems with the turing test  searle asks the reader to imagine a nonchinese speaker in a room in which there are stored a very large number of chinese symbols and rule books   questions are passed to the person in the form of written chinese symbols via a slot and the person responds by looking up the symbols and the correct replies in the rule books   based on the purely inputoutput operations the chinese room gives the appearance of understanding chinese however the person in the room understands no chinese at all   this argument has been the subject of intense philosophical debate since it was introduced in 1980 even leading to edited volumes on this topic alone the application of the turing test to human consciousness has even led to an annual competition the httpwwwloebnernetprizefloebnerprizehtml loebner prize with grand prize of 100000 and a gold medal for the first computer whose responses were indistinguishable from a humans   for a summary of research on the turing test see httpcogsciucsdedu7easayginttttesthtml here with the mirror test devised by gordon gallup in the 1970s one is interested in whether animals are able to recognize themselves in a mirror the classic example of the test involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individuals forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot thus indicating that they recognize that the individual they are seeing in the mirror is themselves  humans older than 18 months and other great apes bottlenose dolphins pigeons elephants and magpies have all been observed to pass this test the test is usually carried out with an identical spot being placed elsewhere on the head with a nonvisible material as a control to assure the subject is not responding to the touch stimuli of the spots presence one problem researchers face is distinguishing nonconscious reflexes and instinctual responses from conscious responses  neuroscientists francis crick and christof koch have proposed that by placing a delay between stimulus and execution of action one may determine the extent of involvement of consciousness in an action of a biological organism for example when psychologists larry squire and robert clark combined a tone of a specific pitch with a puff of air to the eye test subjects came to blink their eyes in anticipation of the puff of air when the appropriate tone was played  when the puff of air followed a half of a second later no such conditioning occurred  when subjects were asked about the experiment only those who were asked to pay attention could consciously distinguish which tone preceded the puff of air ability to delay the response to an action implies that the information must be stored in shortterm memory which is conjectured to be a closely associated prerequisite for consciousness  however this test is only valid for biological organisms  while it is simple to create a computer program that passes such success does not suggest anything beyond a clever programmer the merkwelt german way of viewing the world peculiar individual consciousness is a concept in robotics psychology and biology that describes a creature or androids capacity to view things manipulate information and synthesize to make meaning out of the universe in biology a sharks merkwelt for instance is dominated by smell due to its enlarged olfactory lobes whilst a bats is dominated by its hearing especially at ultrasonic frequencies  in literature a characters merkwelt can be defined by their particular consciousness  for the collective the plural is merkwelten it is related to the original german meaning of zeitgeist and indeed a merkwelt can be thought of as a more general individual zeitgeist to have a merkwelt the individual must be selfaware  this selfawareness may involve thoughts sensations perceptions moods emotions and dreams  this term was particularly developed by the german biologist jakob von uexkll who framed it as part of his theory of umwelt  this basically stated that any living observer of the broader environment or umwelt through their particular werkwelt or mechanical viewing that is to say the organs through which they view the world their eyes ears mouth etc in humans and electrical sensors in sharks for instance could have a merkwelt or perceptual universe  in essence his theory posits that the way each human or certain type of aware animal perceives of their environment both through their experiences the particular way their organs perceive their environment and the way in which their consciousness processes this information how their brain works', 'chicano the terms chicano and chicana also spelled xicana were originally used by americans in reference to us citizens of mexican descent particularly those who are indigenous to the american states belonging to mexico prior to the mexicanamerican war historically they can be viewed as descendants of spanishspeaking native americans who were more integrated into spanish colonial mexican culture the term began to be widely used during the chicano movement mainly among mexican americans especially in the movements peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s the origin of the word chicano is a shorterned form of mexicano mexican in spanish mexico as spoken in its original nahuatl and by the spaniards at the time of the conquest was pronounced originally with a sh sound as opposed to current pronunciation and transcribed with an x as was the usage in spanish at the time the difference between the pronunciation and spelling of chicano and mexicano stems from the fact that the modernday spanish language experienced a change in pronunciation regarding a majority of words containing the x eg  mxico ximenez xavier xarabe the sh sound was dropped and in most but not all cases accompanied by a change of spelling x to j the word chicano in the us was evidently not affected by this change chicano poet and writer tino villanueva traces the first documented use of the term to 1911 as referenced in a thenunpublished essay by university of texas anthropologist jos limn linguists edward r simmen and richard f bauerle report the use of the term in an essay by mexican american writer mario surez published in the arizona quarterly in 1947  mexican americans were not identified as a racialethnic category prior to the 1980 us census when the term hispanic was first used some believe that the word chicamo somehow became chicano which unlike chicamo reflects the grammatical conventions of spanishlanguage ethno and demonyms such as americano castellano or peruano   however this is highly unlikely and chicanos generally do not agree that chicamo was ever a word used within the culture as its assertion is thus far entirely unsubstantiated  therefore most chicanos do not agree that chicano was ever derived from the word chicamo  there is ample literary evidence to further substantiate that chicano is a selfdeclaration as a large body of chicano literature exists with publication dates far predating the 1950s  there is also a substantial body of chicano literature that predates both raso and the federal census bureau as stated in the handbook of texas thus far the origins of the word remain inconclusive as the term is not used outside mexicanamerican communities further indicating that the term is primarily selfidentifying the terms meanings are highly debatable but selfdescribed chicanos view the term as a positive selfidentifying social construction  outside of mexicanamerican communities the term is considered pejorative and takes on subjective view but usually consists of one or more of the following elements from a popular perspective the term chicano became widely visible outside of chicano communities during the american civil rights movement it was commonly used during the mid 1960s by mexican american activists who in attempt to reassert their civil rights tried to rid the word of its polarizing negative connotation by reasserting a unique ethnic identity and political consciousness proudly identifying themselves as chicanos some believe that chicano can also represent chicago il people who are from mexico as of a combination of  chicagomexicanosuggested by carlos flores others believe it was a corrupted term of chilango an inhabitant from mexico city and even from the term chileno by the chilean presence in mid 19thcentury california  according to the handbook of texas at certain points in the 1970s chicano was the preferred term for reference to mexicanamericans particularly in the scholarly literature  however as the term became politicized its use fell out of favor as a means of referring to the entire population  since then chicano has tended to refer to politicized mexicanamericans sabine ulibarri an author from tierra amarilla new mexico once attempted to note that chicano was a politically loaded term although ulibarri has recanted that assessment  chicano is considered to be a positive term of honor by many for chicanos the term usually implies being neither from here nor from there in reference to the us and mexico as a mixture of cultures from both countries being chicano represents the struggle of being accepted into the anglodominated society of the united states while maintaining the cultural sense developed as a latinocultured us born mexican child chicanos are indigenous to the states that were once part of mexico as involuntary immigrants they have more in common with native americans than mexicanamerican immigrants another theory is the origin of such terminology is from the maya temple chichen itza in the yucatan peninsula a ruin of an ancient mesoamerican civilization about 1500 years ago  chicano may be a hispanized word for chichen or the mayan descendants not limited to aztec descendants or nahuatl people reies tijerina was a vocal claimant to the rights of hispanics and mexican americans and he remains a major figure of the early chicano movement long a disparaging term in mexico the term chicano gradually transformed from a classbased term of derision to one of ethnic pride and general usage within mexicanamerican communities beginning with the rise of the chicano movement in the 1960s  in their latinas in the united states a historical encyclopedia vicki ruz and virginia snchez report that demographic differences in the adoption of the term existed because of the prior vulgar connotations it was more likely to be used by males than females and as well less likely to be used among those in a higher socioeconomic status  usage was also generational with the more assimilated thirdgeneration members again more likely male likely to adopt the usage  this group was also younger of more radical persuasion and less connected to a mexican cultural heritage in his essay chicanismo in the oxford encyclopedia of mesoamerican cultures 2002 jose cuellar dates the transition from derisive to positive to the late 1950s with a usage by young mexicanamerican high school students outside of mexican american communities the term might assume a negative meaning if it is used in a manner that embodies the prejudices and bigotries long directed at mexican and mexicanamerican people in the united states for example in one case a prominent chicana feminist writer and poet has indicated the following subjective meaning through her creative work ana castillo has referred to herself as a chicana and her literary work reflects that she primarily considers the term to be a positive one of selfdetermination and political solidarity the mexican archeologist and anthropologist manuel gamio reported in 1930 that the term chicamo with an m was used as a derogatory term used by hispanic texans for recently arrived mexican immigrants displaced during the mexican revolution in the beginning of the early 20th century in mexico which by american standards would be considered classist or racist the term is associated with a mexicanamerican person of low importance class and poor morals while many mexican americans embrace the term chicano others prefer to identify themselves as chicanos regardless of their generational status tend to connect their culture to the indigenous peoples of north america and to a nation of aztln some historians may place aztln in nayarit or the caribbean while other historians entirely disagree and make a distinction between legend and the contemporary sociopolitical ideology many currents came together to produce the revived chicano political movement of the 1960s and 1970s  early struggles were against school segregation but the mexican american cause or la causa as it was called soon came under the banner of the united farm workers and csar chvez however corky gonzales and reies tijerina stirred up old tensions about new mexican land claims with roots going back to before the mexicanamerican war simultaneous movements like the young lords to empower youth question patriarchy democratize the church end police brutality and end the vietnam war all intersected with other ethnic nationalist peace countercultural and feminist movements since chicanismo covers a wide array of political religious and ethnic beliefs and not everybody agrees with what exactly a chicano is most new latino immigrants see it as a lost cause as a lost culture because chicanos do not identify with mexico or wherever their parents migrated from as new immigrants do  chicanoism is an appreciation of a historical movement but also is used by many to bring a new revived politicized feeling to voters young and old in the defense of mexican and mexicanamerican rights  people descended from aztlan both in the contemporary us and in mexico use the chicano ideology to create a platform for fighting for immigration reform and equality for all people for some chicano ideals involve a rejection of borders the 1848 treaty of guadalupe hidalgo transformed the rio grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the united states government  at the end of the mexicanamerican war 80000 spanishmexicanindian people were forced into sudden us habitation paired with the dissipation of militant political efforts of the chicano movement in the 1960s was the emergence of the chicano generation  like their political predecessors the chicano generation rejects the immigrantforeigner categorization status the shared spanish language catholic faith close contact with their political homeland mexico to the south a history of labor segregation ethnic exclusion and racial discrimination encourage a united chicano or mexican folkloric tradition in the united states ethnic cohesiveness is a resistance strategy to assimilation and the accompanying cultural dissolution the term chicano is also used to describe the literary artistic and musical movements that emerged with the chicano movement chicano literature tends to focus on themes of identity discrimination and culture with an emphasis on validating mexican american and chicano culture in the united states rodolfo corky gonzaless yo soy joaquin is one of the first examples of chicano poetry while jos antonio villarreals pocho is widely recognized as the first major chicanoa novel the novel chicano by richard vasquez was the first novel about mexicanamericans to be released by a major publisher doubleday 1970  it was widely read in high schools and universities during the 1970s and has now been recognized as a literary classic vasquez writing having been compared to upton sinclair and john steinbeck other important writers in the genre include rudolfo anaya sandra cisneros gary soto raul salinas and oscar zeta acosta in the visual arts works by chicanos address similar themes as works in literature the preferred media for chicano art are murals and graphic arts  san diegos chicano park home to the largest collection of murals in the world was created as an outgrowth of the citys political movement by chicanos rasquache art is a unique style subset of the chicano arts movement chicano performance art blends humor and pathos for tragicomic effect as shown by los angeles comedy troupe culture clash and mexicanborn performance artist guillermo gomezpena one of the most powerful and farreaching cultural aspects of chicano culture is the indigenous current that strongly roots chicano culture to the american continent it also unifies chicanismo within the larger pan indian movement since its arrival in 1974 what is known as danza azteca in the us and known by several names in its homeland of the central states of mexico danza conchera de la conquista chichimeca etc has had a deep impact in chicano muralism graphic design tattoo art flash poetry music and literature  lowrider cars also figure prominently as functional art in the chicano community lalo guerrero is regarded as the founder of chicano music  beginning in the 1930s he wrote songs in the big band and swing genres that were popular at the time he expanded his repertoire to include songs written in traditional genres of the mexican music and during the farmworkers rights campaign wrote music in support of csar chvez and the united farm workers selena in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s a wave of chicano pop music surfaced through innovative musicians johnny rodriguez ritchie valens carlos santana and linda ronstadt joan baez who was also of mexicanamerican descent included hispanic themes in some of her protest folk songs  chicano rock is rock music performed by chicano groups or music with themes derived from chicano culture there are two undercurrents in chicano rock  one is a devotion to the original rhythm and blues roots of rock and roll including ritchie valens sunny and the sunglows and and the mysterians groups inspired by this include sir douglas quintet thee midniters los lobos war tierra and el chicano and of course the chicano blues man himself the late randy garribay the second theme is the openness to latin american sounds and influences  trini lopez santana malo azteca toro ozomatli and other chicano latin rock groups follow this approach  chicano rock crossed paths of other latin rock genres rock en espanol by cubans puerto ricans and south america la nueva cancion rock band the mars volta combines elements of progressive rock with traditional mexican folk music and latin rhythms along with cedric bixlerzavalas spanglish lyrics chicano punk is a branch of chicano rock  examples of the genre include music by the bands the zeros los illegals the brat the plugz manic hispanic and the cruzados these bands emerged from the california punk scene some music historians argue that chicanos of los angeles in the late 1970s might have independently cofounded punk rock along with the alreadyacknowledged founders from britisheuropean sources when introduced to the us in major cities the rock band  mark and the mysterians which was composed primarily of mexican american musicians was the first band to be described as punk rock the term was reportedly coined in 1971 by rock critic dave marsh in a review of their show for creem magazine although latin jazz is most popularly associated with artists from the caribbean particularly cuba and brazil young mexican americans have played a role in its development over the years going back to the 1930s and early 1940s the era of the zoot suit when young mexican american musicians in los angeles and san jose began to experiment with banda a jazzlike mexican music that has grown recently in popularity among mexican americans such as jenni rivera chicano rap is a unique style of hip hop music which started with kid frost who saw some mainstream exposure in the early 1990s  while mellow man ace was the first mainstream rapper to use spanglish frosts song la raza paved the way for its use in american hip hop  chicano rap tends to discuss themes of importance to young urban chicanos some of todays chicano artists include psycho realm sick symphonies street platoon el vuh baby bash and lighter shade of brown as well as aka down kilo with definition of an ese which denotes a historical account of chicano popularity in southern california paula deanda frankie j old member of the kumbia kings and associated with baby bash other famous chicanomexican american singers include selena who sang a variety of mexican tejano and american popular music but was killed in 1995 at the age of 23 zack de la rocha lead vocalist of rage against the machine and social activist and los lonely boys a texas style country rock band who have not ignored their mexican american roots in their music  in recent years a growing texmex polka band trend from mexican immigrants ie  conjunto or norteo has influenced much of new chicano folk music especially in large market spanish language radio stations and on television music video programs in the us the band quetzal is known for its political songs', 'carlogoldoni there is an abundance of autobiographical information on goldoni most of which comes from the introductions to his plays and from his memoirs however these memoirs are known to contain many errors of fact especially about his earlier years in these memoirs he paints himself as a born comedian careless lighthearted and with a happy temperament proof against all strokes of fate yet thoroughly respectable and honorable  such characters were common enough in italy goldoni was born in venice in 1707 the son of margherita and giulio goldoni in his memoirs goldoni describes his father as a physician and claims that he was introduced to theatre by his grandfather carlo alessandro goldoni in reality it seems that giulio was an apothecary as for the grandfather he had died four years before carlos birth  in any case goldoni was deeply interested in theatre from his earliest years and all attempts to direct his activity into other channels were of no avail his toys were puppets and his books plays his father placed him under the care of the philosopher caldini at rimini but the youth soon ran away with a company of strolling players and returned to venice in 1723 his father matriculated him into the stern collegio ghislieri in pavia which imposed the tonsure and monastic habits on its students  however he relates in his memoirs that a considerable part of his time was spent in reading greek and latin comedies he had already begun writing at this time and in his third year he composed a libellous poem il colosso in which he ridiculed the daughters of certain pavian families  as a result of that incident andor of a visit paid with some schoolmates to a local brothel he was expelled from the school and had to leave the city 1725  he studied law at udine and eventually took his degree at modena he was employed as a law clerk at chioggia and feltre after which he returned to his native city and began practicing educated as a lawyer and holding lucrative positions as secretary and counsellor he seemed indeed at one time to have settled down to the practice of law but following an unexpected summons to venice after an absence of several years he changed his career and thenceforth he devoted himself to writing plays and managing theatres  his father died in 1731  in 1732 to avoid an unwanted marriage he left the town for milan and then for verona where the theatre manager giuseppe imer helped him on his way to becoming a comical poet as well as introducing him to his future wife nicoletta conio goldoni returned with her to venice where he stayed until 1743 he entered the italian theatre scene with a tragedy amalasunta produced in milan the play was a critical and financial failure submitting it to count prata director of the opera he was told that his piece was composed with due regard for the rules of aristotle and horace but not according to those laid down for the italian drama  in france continued the count you can try to please the public but here in italy it is the actors and actresses whom you must consult as well as the composer of the music and the stage decorators  everything must be done according to a certain form which i will explain to you goldoni thanked his critic went back to his inn and ordered a fire into which he threw the manuscript of his amalasunta his next play belisario written in 1734 was more successful though of its success he afterward professed himself ashamed during this period he also wrote librettos for opera seria and served for a time as literary director of the san giovanni grisostomo venices most distinguished opera house he wrote other tragedies for a time but he was not long in discovering that his bent was for comedy he had come to realize that the italian stage needed reforming adopting molire as his model he went to work in earnest and in 1738 produced his first real comedy luomo di mondo the man of the world during his many wanderings and adventures in italy he was constantly at work and when at livorno he became acquainted with the manager medebac he determined to pursue the profession of playwriting in order to make a living he was employed by medebac to write plays for his theater in venice he worked for other managers and produced during his stay in that city some of his most characteristic works he also wrote momolo cortesan in 1738  by 1743 he had perfected his hybrid style of playwriting combining the model of molire with the strengths of commedia dellarte and his own wit and sincerity  this style was typified in la donna di garbo the first italian comedy of its kind after 1748 goldoni collaborated with the composer baldassare galuppi making significant contributions to the new form of opera buffa  galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of goldonis librettos  as with his comedies goldonis opera buffa integrate elements of the commedia dellarte with recognisable local and middleclass realities  his operatic works include two of the most successful musical comedies of the eighteenth century il filosofo di campagna the country philosopher set by galuppi 1752 and la buona figliuola the good girl set by niccol piccinni 1760 in 1753 following his return from bologna he defected to the teatro san luca of the vendramin family where he performed most of his plays to 1762 in 1757 he engaged in a bitter dispute with playwright carlo gozzi which left him utterly disgusted with the tastes of his countrymen so much so that in 1761 he moved to paris where he received a position at court and was put in charge of the theatre italien he spent the rest of his life in france composing most of his plays in french and writing his memoirs in that language among the plays which he wrote in french the most successful was le bourru bienfaisant produced on the occasion of the marriage of louis xvi and marie antoinette in 1771  he enjoyed considerable popularity in france when he retired to versailles the king gave him a pension he lost this pension after the french revolution the convention eventually voted to restore his pension the day after his death it was restored to his widow at the pleading of the poet andr chnier she is old he urged she is seventysix and her husband has left her no heritage save his illustrious name his virtues and his poverty goldoni relates in considerable length in his memoirs the state of italian comedy when he began writing  at that time italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the commedia dellarte or improvised comedy  goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners he rightly maintained that italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before his works are a lasting monument to the changes that he initiated a dramatic revolution that had been attempted but not achieved before  goldonis importance lay in providing good examples rather than precepts  goldoni says that he took for his models the plays of molire and that whenever a piece of his own succeeded he whispered to himself  good but not yet molire goldonis plays are gentler and more optimistic in tone than molires it was this very success that was the object of harsh critiques by carlo gozzi who accused goldoni of having deprived the italian theatre of the charms of poetry and imagination the great success of gozzis fairy dramas so irritated goldoni that it led to his selfexile to france goldoni gave to his country a classical form which though it has since been cultivated has yet to be cultivated by a master goldonis plays that were written while he was still in italy ignore religious and ecclesiastical subjects  this may be surprising considering his staunch catholic upbringing  no thoughts are expressed about death or repentance in his memoirs or in his comedies  after his move to france his position became clearer as his plays took on a clear anticlerical tone and often satirized the hypocrisy of monks and of the church goldoni was inspired by his love of humanity and the admiration he had for his fellow men he wrote and was obsessed with the relationships that humans establish with one another their cities and homes the humanist movement and the study of philosophy the moral and civil values that goldoni promotes in his plays are those of rationality civility humanism the importance of the rising middleclass a progressive stance to state affairs honor and honesty  goldoni had a dislike for arrogance intolerance and the abuse of power goldonis main characters are no abstract examples of human virtue nor monstrous examples of human vice they occupy the middle ground of human temperament  goldoni maintains an acute sensibility for the differences in social classes between his characters as well as environmental and generational changes  goldoni pokes fun at the arrogant nobility and the pauper who lacks dignity as in other theatrical works of the time and place the characters in goldonis italian comedies spoke originally either the literary tuscan variety which became modern italian or the venetian dialect depending on their station in life  however in some printed editions of his plays he often turned the venetian texts into tuscan too', 'continuityirishrepublicanarmy the continuity irish republican army cira is an irish republican paramilitary organisation that emerged from a split in the provisional ira in 1986  it is designated as an illegal organisation in the republic of ireland and as a terrorist organisation in the united kingdom and the united states the cira considers itself a direct continuation of the irish republican army the army of the unilaterallydeclared 19191922 irish republic that fought in the irish war of independence as such its supporters regard it as the national army of an irish republic that occupies all 32 counties of the island of ireland the continuity ira has its origins in a split in the provisional ira in september 1986 the provisional ira  held a meeting of its general army convention gac the organisations supreme decisionmaking body it was the first gac in sixteen years the meeting which like all such meetings was secret was convened to discuss among other resolutions the articles of the provisional ira constitution which dealt with abstentionism its opposition to the taking of seats in dil ireann the gac passed motions by the necessary twothirds majority allowing members of the provisional ira to discuss and debate the taking of parliamentary seats and the removal of the ban on members of the organisation from supporting any successful republican candidate who took their seat in dil ireann the provisional ira convention delegates opposed to the change in the constitution claimed that the convention was gerrymandered by the creation of new ira organisational structures for the convention including the combinations of sligoroscommonlongford and wicklowwexfordwaterford the only ira body that supported this viewpoint was the outgoing ira executive those members of the outgoing executive who opposed the change comprised a quorum they met dismissed those in favour of the change and set up a new executive they contacted tom maguire who had legitimated the provisionals in 1969 and asked him for support   maguire had also been contacted by supporters of gerry adams then and now president of sinn fin and a supporter of the change in the provisional ira constitution   maguire rejected adams supporters supported the ira executive members opposed to the change and named the new organisers the continuity army council in a 1986 statement he rejected the legitimacy of an army council styling itself the council of the irish republican army which lends support to any person or organisation styling itself as sinn fin and prepared to enter the partition parliament of leinster house in 1987 maguire described the continuity executive as the lawful executive of the irish republican army thus similar to the claim put forward by the provisional ira after its split from the official ira in 1969 the continuity ira claims to be the legitimate continuation of the irish republican army or glaigh na hireann  this argument is based on the view that the surviving antitreaty members of the second dil delegated their authority to the ira army council in 1938  as further justification for this claim tom maguire one of those antitreaty members of the second dil issued a statement in favour of the continuity ira as he had done in 1969 in favour of the provisionals j bowyer bell in his the irish troubles describes maguires opinion in 1986 abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism a moral issue of principle  abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy the right to wage war to speak for a republic all but established in the hearts of the people  maguires stature was such that a delegation from gerry adams sought his support in 1986 but was rejected these changes within the military wing of the republican movement were accompanied by changes in the political wing and at the 1986 sinn fin ard fheis party conference which followed the ira convention the partys policy of abstentionism which forbade sinn fin elected representatives from taking seats in the oireachtas the parliament of ireland was dropped  on november 2 the 628 delegates present cast their votes the result being 429 to 161  the traditionalists having lost at both conventions walked out of the mansion house met that evening at the west county hotel and reformed as republican sinn fin according to a report in the cork examiner the continuity iras first chief of staff was dith  conaill who also served as the first chairman of rsf from 1986 to 1987  the continuity ira and rsf perceive themselves as forming a true republican movement the leadership of the continuity ira is believed to be based in the munster and ulster areas it is alleged that its chief of staff is a limerick man and that a number of other key members are from that county he is believed to have been in this position since the death of dith  conaill the first chief of staff in 1991  in 2005 irish minister for justice equality and law reform michael mcdowell told dil ireann that the organisation had a maximum of 150 members the cira is an illegal organisation under uk section 111 of the terrorism act 2000 and irish law due to the use of ira in the groups name in a situation analogous to that of the real irish republican army rira membership of the organisation is punishable by a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment under uk law  on 13 july 2004 the us government designated the cira as a foreign terrorist organization fto this made it illegal for americans to provide material support to the cira requires us financial institutions to block the groups assets and denies alleged cira members visas into the us the us government suspects the continuity ira of having received funds and arms from supporters in the united states security sources in ireland have expressed the suspicion that in cooperation with the rira the continuity ira may have acquired arms and material from the balkans they also suspect that the continuity ira arsenal contains some weapons that were taken from provisional ira arms dumps including a few dozen rifles machine guns and pistols a small amount of the explosive semtex and a few dozen detonators initially the continuity ira did not reveal its existence either in the form of press statements or paramilitary activity  although the garda sochna had suspicions that the organisation existed they were unsure of its name labelling it the irish national republican army on january 21 1994 on the 75th anniversary of the first dil ireann continuity ira volunteers offered a final salute to tom maguire by firing over his grave and a public statement and a photo were published in saoirse irish freedom it was only after the provisional ira declared a ceasefire in 1994 that the continuity ira became active announcing its intention to continue the campaign against british rule the cira continues to oppose the belfast agreement and unlike the provisional ira and the real ira in 1998 as of 2009 the cira has not announced a ceasefire or agreed to participate in weapons decommissioning  nor is there any evidence that it will  in the eighteenth independent monitoring commissions report the rira the cira and the irish national liberation army inla were deemed a potential future threat the cira was labeled active dangerous and committed and capable of a greater level of violent and other crime  more than the other republican and loyalist paramilitaries  like the glaigh na hireann onh and the rira they too sought funds for expansion they are also known to have worked with the inla the continuity ira has been involved in a number of bombing and shooting incidents  targets of the cira have included british military police service royal ulster constabulary etc and ulster loyalist paramilitaries  as of 2005 the cira is believed to have an established presence or capability of launching attacks on the island of britain a bomb defused in dublin in december 2005 was believed to have been the work of the cira in february 2006 the independent monitoring commission imc blamed the cira for planting four bombs in northern ireland during the final quarter of 2005 as well as several hoax bomb warnings the imc also blames the cira for the killings of two former cira members in belfast who had stolen cira weapons and established a rival organisation the cira continued to be active in both planning and undertaking attacks on the police service of northern ireland psni the imc said they tried to create troubles to lure police forth while they have also taken to stoning and using petrol bombs  in addition other assaults robbery tiger kidnapping extortion fuel laundering and smuggling were undertaken by the group the cira also actively took part in recruiting and training members including disgruntled former provisional irish republican army pira members  as a result of this continued activity the imc said the group remained a very serious threat on 10 march 2009 the cira claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of a psni officer in craigavon county armagh the first police fatality in northern ireland since 1998  the officer was shot dead by a sniper as he and a colleague investigated suspicious activity at a house nearby when a window was smashed by youths causing the occupant to phone the police the psni officers responded to the emergency call giving a cira sniper the opportunity to shoot and kill pc stephen carroll in 2005 several members of the cira who were serving prison sentences in portlaoise prison for paramilitary activity left the organisation some transferred to the inla landing of the prison but the majority of those who left are now independent and on e4 landing the remaining cira prisoners have moved to d wing supporters of the continuity ira leadership claim that this resulted from an internal disagreement which although brought to a conclusion was followed by some people leaving the organisation anyway  supporters of the disaffected members established the concerned group for republican prisoners in their support  most of those who had left went back to the cira or dissociated themselves from the cgrp as of 2010 only one prisoner is still aligned to the cgrp in february 2006 the independent monitoring commission claimed in a report on paramilitary activity that two groups styling themselves as saoirse na hireann and glaigh na hireann had been formed after a split in the continuity ira', 'cssvirginia when the commonwealth of virginia seceded from the union in 1861 one of the important federal military bases threatened was

was the only large ship with intact engines available to the confederacy in the chesapeake bay area  preliminary sketch designs were submitted by lieutenants john brooke and john l porter each of which envisaged the ship as a casemate ironclad  brookes design showed the ends of the ship as submerged and was selected although detailed design work would be done by porter as he was a trained naval constructor  porter had overall responsibility for the conversion but brooke was responsible for her iron plate and armament while william p williamson chief engineer of the navy was responsible for the ships machinery the burned hull timbers were cut down past the waterline and a new deck and armored casemate fortress were added the deck was convert4 thick iron the casemate was built up of convert24 of oak and pine in several layers topped with two convert2 layers of iron plating oriented perpendicular to each other and angled to deflect shot hits the battery consisted of four singlebanded brooke rifles and six convert9 dahlgren smoothbore shell guns  two of the rifles bow and stern pivots were convert7 of 14500 pounds the other two were convert64 32 pound calibre of 9000 pounds one on each broadside the convert9 gun on each side nearest the furnaces was fitted for firing hot shot a few convert9 shot with extra windage slightly smaller diameter were cast for hot shot  no other solid shot were on board during the fight as virginias designers had heard of plans by the north to build an ironclad and figuring her guns would be unable to harm such a ship they equipped her with a ram at that time an anachronism in a warship  merrimacks steam engines now part of virginia were in poor working order the ship had been slated for an engine rebuild prior to the decision to abandon the norfolk naval yard and the salty elizabeth river water and addition of tons of iron armor and ballast did not improve the situation  as completed css virginia had a turning radius of about one mile 16km and required 45 minutes to complete a full circle which was a major handicap in its battle with the far more nimble uss monitor the commanding officer flag officer franklin buchanan arrived to take command only a few days before sailing the ship was placed in commission and equipped by the executive officer catesby ap r jones the battle of hampton roads began        on march 8 1862 when virginia sortied  despite an allout effort to complete her the ship still had workmen on board when she sailed  supported by raleigh and beaufort and accompanied by patrick henry jamestown and teaser virginia took on the blockading fleet the first ship engaged the wooden sailpowered uss cumberland was sunk after being rammed  however in sinking cumberland broke off virginias ram  seeing what happened to cumberland the captain of uss congress ordered his ship grounded in shallow water  congress and virginia traded fire for an hour after which the badlydamaged congress surrendered  while the surviving crewmen of congress were being ferried off the ship a union battery on the north shore opened fire on virginia in retaliation the captain of virginia ordered to fire upon the surrendered congress with redhot shot to set her ablaze later that night uss monitor arrived at unionheld fort monroe rushed to hampton roads in hopes of protecting the union force and preventing virginia from threatening union cities the next day on march 9 1862 the worlds first battle between ironclads took place the smaller nimbler monitor was able to outmaneuver virginia but neither ship proved able to do significant damage despite numerous hits  monitor was much closer to the water and thus much harder to hit by the virginias guns but vulnerable to ramming and boarding  finally monitor retreated  this was because the captain of the monitor was hit by gunpowder in his eyes while looking through the pilothouses peepholes which caused monitor to haul off the monitor had retreated off into the shoals and remained there and so the battle was a draw the captain of virginia lieutenant catesby ap roger jones csn received the advice from his pilots to take the midnight high tide to depart back over the bar toward the cs navy base at norfolk until noon of the next day   lieutenant jones wanted instead to reattack but to turn the ship and fight the starboard gun was impossible for heading up stream on a strong floodtide she would have been wholly unmanageable the pilots emphasized that the virginia had nearly three miles to run to the bar and that she could not remain and take the ground on a falling tide   so to prevent getting stuck lieutenant jones called off the battle and moved back toward harbor   after the battle with the monitor the virginia retired to the gosport naval yard at portsmouth viriginia for repairs and remained in drydock until april 4 1862 in the following month the crew of the virginia were unsuccessful in their attempts to break the union blockade the blockade had been bolstered by the hastily ramfitted ss vanderbilt and ss illinois as well as the ss arago and uss minnesota which had been repaired the virginia made several sorties back over to hampton roads hoping to draw monitor into battle  monitor however was under orders not to engage on april 11 the confederate navy sent lieutenant joseph nicholson barney in command of the sidepaddle css jamestown along with the virginia and five other ships in full view of the union squadron enticing them to fight   when it became clear that the us navy ships were unwilling to fight the cs navy squadron moved in and captured three merchant ships the brigs marcus and sabout and the schooner catherine t dix their flags were then hoisted unionside down to further taunt the us navy into a fight as they were towed back to norfolk with the help of the css raleigh neither ironclad was ever to fight again   by late april the new union ironclads uss naugatuckusrc e a stevens and uss galena had also joined the blockade  on may 8 1862 virginia and the james river squadron ventured out when the union ships began shelling the confererate fortifications near norfolk but the union ships retired under the shore batteries on the north side of the james river and on rip raps island on may 10 1862 advancing union troops occupied norfolk since virginia was a steampowered battery and not a cruiser she was not seaworthy enough to enter the ocean even if she was able to pass the union blockade  virginia was also unable to retreat further up the james river due to her deep convert22 draft  in an attempt to reduce her draft supplies and coal were dumped overboard but this exposed the unclad wooden hull   without a home port virginia was ordered blown up to keep her from being captured  this task fell to lieutenant jones the last man to leave css virginia after all of her guns had been safely removed and carried to the cs marine corps base and fortifications at drewys bluff to fight again  early on the morning of may 11 1862 off craney island fire reached her magazine and she was destroyed by a great explosion the uss monitor was lost on december 31 of the same year when the vessel was swamped in a storm while under tow off cape hatteras north carolina the name of the warship which served the confederacy in the battle of hampton roads has become a source of confusion which continues to the present day when she was first commissioned into the united states navy in 1856 her name was merrimack with the k the name derived from the merrimack river near where she was built she was the second ship of the us navy to be named for the merrimack river which is formed by the junction of the pemigewasset and winnipesaukee rivers at franklin new hampshire the merrimack flows south across new hampshire and then eastward across northeastern massachusetts before emptying in the atlantic at newburyport massachusetts the confederacy bestowed the name virginia on her when she was raised restored and outfitted as an ironclad warship but the union preferred to call the confederate ironclad warship by either its earlier name merrimack or by the nickname the rebel monster perhaps because the union won the civil war the history of the united states generally records the union version in the aftermath of the battle the names virginia and merrimack were used equally by both sides as attested by the newspapers and correspondence of the day some navy reports and pre1900 historians misspelled the name as merrimac which is actually an unrelated ship  hence the battle of the monitor and the merrimac both spellings are still in use in the hampton roads area', 'chomskyhierarchy this hierarchy of grammars was described by noam chomsky in1956 it is also named after marcelpaul schtzenberger who played a crucial role in the development of the theory of formal languages a formal grammar of this type consists of a formal grammar defines or generates a formal language which is a usually infinite set of finitelength sequences of symbols ie strings that may be constructed by applying production rules to another sequence of symbols which initially contains just the start symbol a rule may be applied to a sequence of symbols by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on the lefthand side of the rule with those that appear on the righthand side a sequence of rule applications is called a derivation   such a grammar defines the formal language all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol nonterminals are usually represented by uppercase letters terminals by lowercase letters and the start symbol by s  for example the grammar with terminals a b nonterminals s a b production rules the following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language terminals a b nonterminals s start symbol s production rules the chomsky hierarchy consists of the following levels note that the set of grammars corresponding to recursive languages is not a member of this hierarchy every regular language is contextfree every contextfree language not containing the empty string is contextsensitive and every contextsensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable  these are all proper inclusions meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages which are not contextsensitive contextsensitive languages which are not contextfree and contextfree languages which are not regular the following table summarizes each of chomskys four types of grammars the class of language it generates the type of automaton that recognizes it and the form its rules must have however there are further categories of formal languages some of which are given in the following table', 'chernobyl the city was evacuated in 1986 due to the chernobyl disaster at the chernobyl nuclear power plant located 145 kilometers 9 miles northnorthwest the power plant was within chernobyl raion district but the city was not the residence of the power plant workers  when the power plant was under construction prypiat a city larger and closer to the power plant had been built as home for the power plant workers  after the accident the chernobyl raion administration was transferred to the neighboring ivankiv raion though the city today is mostly uninhabited a small number of people reside in houses marked with signs stating that the owner of this house lives here  workers on watch and administrative personnel of the zone of alienation are stationed in the city on a long term basis  prior to its evacuation the city was inhabited by about 14000 residents the city of slavutych was built specifically for the evacuated population of chernobyl although it is still mostly uninhabited rumors exist that the ukraine government want to make chernobyl a future tourist location the city is named after the ukrainian word for mugwort or wormwood artemisia vulgaris which is  chornobyl the word is a combination of the words chornyi  black and byllia  grass blades or stalks hence it literally means black grass or black stalks  that may signify burnt grass perhaps prior to cultivation chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193 described as a huntinglodge of knyaz rostislavich it was a crown village of the grand duchy of lithuania in the 13th century the village was granted as a fiefdom to filon kmita a captain of the royal cavalry in 1566  the province containing chernobyl was transferred to the kingdom of poland in 1569 and then annexed by the russian empire in 1793  prior to the 20th century chernobyl was inhabited by ukrainian and some polish peasants and a relatively large number of jews chernobyl had a rich religious history the jews were brought by filon kmita during the polish campaign of colonization the traditionally christian eastern orthodox ukrainian peasantry of the district was largely forced by poland to convert to the greek catholic uniate religion after 1596 and returned to eastern orthodoxy only after ukraine was annexed by muscovy the dominican church and monastery were founded in 1626 by lukasz sapieha at the height of the counterreformation  there was a group of old catholics who opposed the decrees of the council of trent the dominican monastery was sequestrated in 1832 and the church of the old catholics was disbanded in 1852 in the second half of the 18th century chernobyl became one of the major centers of hasidic judaism the chernobyl hasidic dynasty had been founded by rabbi menachem nachum twersky the jewish population suffered greatly from pogroms in october 1905 and in marchapril 1919 when many jews were killed and others were robbed at the instigation of the russian nationalist black hundreds in 1920 the twersky dynasty left chernobyl and it ceased to exist as a hasidic center since the 1880s chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune  in 1898 chernobyl had a population of 10800 including 7200 jews in world war i the village was occupied and in the ensuing civil war chernobyl was fought over by bolsheviks and ukrainians in the polishsoviet war of 191920 it was taken first by the polish army and then by cavalry of the red army from 1921 it was incorporated into the ukrainian ssr during the period 192933 chernobyl suffered greatly from mass killings during stalins collectivization campaign and in the holodomor famine that followed the polish community of chernobyl was deported to kazakhstan in 1936 during the frontier clearances the jewish community was murdered during the german occupation of 194144 the duga3 overthehorizon radar array several miles out of chernobyl was the origin of the infamous russian woodpecker designed as part of russias antiballistic missile early warning radar network with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 chernobyl remained part of ukraine now an independent nation however in 2010 there

the chernobyl accident in chernobyl disaster on april 26 1986 reactor 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plant near the town of pripyat ukraine exploded the explosion took place at around one in the morning while the neighboring town of pripyat slept  two workers were killed instantly  forty hours later the residents of pripyat were ordered to evacuate and most never returned by that time many of the residents had suffered varying degrees of radiation poisoning in 2003 the united nations development programme launched a project called the chernobyl recovery and development programme crdp for the recovery of the affected areas the program launched its activities based on the human consequences of the chernobyl nuclear accident report recommendations and was initiated in february 2002  the

be either spontaneous requiring no input of energy or nonspontaneous typically following the input of some type of energy viz heat light or electricity  classically chemical reactions encompass changes that strictly involve the motion of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds although the general concept of a chemical reaction in particular the notion of a chemical equation is applicable to transformations of elementary particles as well as nuclear reactions the substance or substances initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents  chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change and they yield one or more products which usually have properties different from the reactants  reactions often consist of a sequence of individual substeps the socalled elementary reactions and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism  chemical reactions are described with chemical equations which graphically present the starting materials end products and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions different chemical reactions are used in combination in chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product  in biochemistry series of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes form metabolic pathways by which syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions are performed within a cell chemical reactions such as combustion in the fire fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity  initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by greek philosophers such as the fourelement theory of empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements  fire water air and earth  in the middle ages chemical transformations were studied by alchemist they attempted in particular to convert lead into gold for which purpose they used reactions of lead and leadcopper alloys with sulfur the production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist jbir ibn hayyn the process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate alum and saltpeter  in the 17th century johann rudolph glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride  with the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the leblanc process allowing largescale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate respectively chemical reactions became implemented into the industry  further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in 1880s and the haber process  was developed in 19091910 for ammonia synthesis from the 16th century researchers including jan baptist van helmont robert boyle and isaac newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations the phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by johann joachim becher it postulated the existence of a firelike element called phlogiston which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion  this proved to be false in 1785 by antoine lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air joseph louis gaylussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other  based on this idea and the atomic theory of john dalton joseph proust had developed the law of definite proportions which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations regarding the organic chemistry it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically  according to the concept of vitalism organic matter was endowed with a vital force and distinguished from inorganic materials  this separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by friedrich whler in 1828  other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include alexander william williamson with his synthesis of ethers and christopher kelk ingold who among many discoveries established the mechanisms of substitution reactions chemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions they consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right they are separated by an arrow  which indicates the direction and type of the reaction the tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds a double arrow  pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions  equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation  this is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules a b c and d in a schematic example below by the appropriate integers a b c and d more complex reactions are represented by reaction schemes which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states  also some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow examples of such additions are water heat illumination a catalyst etc  similarly some minor products can be placed below the arrow often with a minus sign retrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction  here the analysis starts from the products for example by splitting selected chemical bonds to arrive at plausible initial reagents a special arrow  is used in retro reactions the elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed to it has no intermediate products  most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially the actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism an elementary reaction involves a few molecules usually one or two because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time the most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions  only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation in one or more other molecules  such reaction requires addition of energy in the form of heat or light a typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cistrans isomerization in which the cisform of a compound converts to the transform or vice versa in a typical dissociation reaction a bond in a molecule splits resulting in two molecular fragments the splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic  in the first case the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical  in the second case both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products resulting in charged ions  dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions such as hydrogenoxygen or polymerization reactions for bimolecular reactions two molecules collide and react with each other  their merger is called  chemical synthesis or an addition reaction another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule  this type of reaction occurs for example in redox and acidbase reactions  in redox reactions the transferred particle is an electron whereas in acidbase reactions it is a proton  this type of reaction is also called metathesis most chemical reactions are reversible that is they can and do run in both directions the forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates  these rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction establishing the socalled chemical equilibrium the time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature pressure and the materials involved and is determined by the minimum free energy  in equilibrium the gibbs free energy must be zero the pressure dependence can be explained with the le chateliers principle  for example an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas the reaction yield stabilized at equilibrium but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or increasing temperature or pressure  change in the initial concentrations of the substances does not affect the equilibrium chemical reactions are largely determined by the laws of thermodynamics  reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic that is if they release energy the associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities enthalpy and entropy reactions can be exothermic where h is negative and energy is released  typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases  in contrast in endothermic reactions heat is consumed from the environment  this can occur by increasing the entropy of the system often through the formation of gaseous reaction products which have high entropy  since the entropy increases with temperature many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures  on the contrary many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures  changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the direction of a reaction as in the boudouard reaction this reaction between carbon dioxide and carbon to form carbon monoxide is endothermic at temperatures above approximately 800 c and is exothermic below this temperature reactions can also be characterized with the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy volume and chemical potential the latter depends among other things on the activities of the involved substances the speed at which a reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics the rate depends on various parameters such as several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level  this field is referred to as reaction dynamics the rate v of a firstorder reaction which could be disintegration of a substance a is given by its integration yields here k is firstorder rate constant having dimension 1time at is concentration at a time t and a0 is the initial concentration the rate of a firstorder reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic halflife  more than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order the temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the arrhenius equation redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species reducing agent to another oxidizing agent  in this process the former species is oxidized and the latter is reduced thus the term redox  though sufficient for many purposes these descriptions are not precisely correct  oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number  in practice the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation number but there are many reactions that are classed as redox even though no electron transfer occurs such as those involving covalent bonds an example of a redox reaction is here i2 is reduced to i and s2o32 thiosulfate anion is oxidized to s4o62 which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements  elements with low electronegativity such as most metals easily donate electrons and oxidize  they are reducing agents  on the contrary many ions with high oxidation numbers such as     can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents the number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from electron configuration of the reactant element  elements are trying to reach the lowenergy noble gas configuration and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively and the noble gases themselves are chemically inactive an important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions where the electrons from the power supply are used as a reducing agent  these reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements such as chlorine or aluminium the reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and is used in the batteries in complexation reactions several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex  this is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds the ligands are lewis bases they can be both ions and neutral molecules such as carbon monoxide ammonia or water the number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18electron rule saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory  complexation reactions also include ligand exchange in which one or more ligands are replaced by another and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom acidbase reactions involve transfer of protons from one molecule acid to another base  here acids act as proton donors and bases as acceptors the associated proton transfer results in the socalled conjugate acid and conjugate base the reverse reaction is possible and thus the acidbase and conjugated baseacid are always in equilibrium the equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants ka and kb of the involved substances a special case of the acidbase reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base taken at exactly same amounts form a neutral salt acidbase reactions can have different definitions depending on the acidbase concept employed some of the most common are precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction it usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt  this process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent  rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals the latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts reactions can take place between two solids  however because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow they are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area in photochemical reactions atoms and molecules absorb energy photons of the illumination light and convert into an excited state they can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds thereby producing radicals  photochemical reactions include hydrogenoxygen reactions radical polymerization chain reactions and rearrangement reactions many important processes involve photochemistry the premier example is photosynthesis in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose disposing of oxygen as a sideproduct  humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin d and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin  in fireflies an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence  many significant photochemical reactions such as ozone formation occur in the earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry in catalysis the reaction does not proceed directly but through a third substance known as catalyst  unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself however it can be inhibited deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes  catalysts can be used in a different phase heterogeneous or in the same phase homogenous as the reactants  in heterogeneous catalysis typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products  additionally heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solidliquid system or evaporate in a solidgas system  catalysts can only speed up the reaction  chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors  substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons  with a catalyst a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids powdered in order to maximize their surface area  of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals which are used in hydrogenations catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia  acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles the advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants but they may also be difficult to separate from the products  therefore heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes in organic chemistry in addition to oxidation reduction or acidbase reactions a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms such as oxygen nitrogen halogens etc  many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers in a substitution reaction a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group  these reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic electrophilic or radical substitution in the first type a nucleophile an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge replaces another atom or part of the substrate molecule the electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond while the leaving group departs with an electron pair the nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged  examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion alkoxides amines and halides  this type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon the latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups  nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms sn1 and sn2 in their names s stands for substitution n for nucleophilic and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction unimolecular or bimolecular the sn1 reaction proceeds in two steps  first the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation  this is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile in the sn2 mechanism the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule and only then the leaving group is cleaved  these two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products  sn1 leads to the nonstereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center but rather in a set of geometric isomers cistrans  in contrast a reversal walden inversion of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the sn2 mechanism electrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule an electrophile has low electron density and thus a positive charge  typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations  this reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution the electrophile attack results in the socalled complex a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished  then the leaving group usually a proton is split off and the aromaticity is restored an alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution it is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types se1 and se2 in the third type of substitution reaction radical substitution the attacking particle is a radical the addition and its counterpart the elimination are reactions which change the number of substituents on the carbon atom and form or cleave multiple bonds  double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group  similar to the nucleophilic substitution there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order  in the e1 mechanism the leaving group is ejected first forming a carbocation the next step formation of the double bond takes place with elimination of a proton deprotonation the leaving order is reversed in the e1cb mechanism that is the proton is split off first  this mechanism requires participation of a base  because of the similar conditions both reactions in the e1 or e1cb elimination always compete with the sn1 substitution the e2 mechanism also requires a base but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate  in contrast to the e1 eliminations different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the e2 mechanism because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the antiposition with respect to the leaving group  because of the similar conditions and reagents the e2 elimination is always in competition with the sn2substitution the counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds  similar to the substitution reactions there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle  for example in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide an electrophile proton attacks the double bond forming a carbocation which then reacts with the nucleophile bromine the carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the markovnikovs rule  this rule states that in the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne the more electronegative nucleophilic atom or part of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms if the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible  in this case one has to use the hydroborationoxidation reaction where in the first step the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom  at the second step the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom while the addition to the electronrich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbonheteroatom multiple bonds and especially its most important representative the carbonyl group  this process is often associated with an elimination so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again it is therefore called additionelimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides esters or anhydrides  this reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the michael reaction which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions  this is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of cc bonds some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles can be succeeded with free radicals  as with the freeradical substitution the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction and such reactions are the basis of the freeradical polymerization in a rearrangement reaction the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule  these include hydride shift reactions such as the wagnermeerwein rearrangement where a hydrogen alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon  most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carboncarbon bonds  other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the cope rearrangement cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and more generally pericyclic reactions wherein two or more double bondcontaining molecules form a cyclic molecule an important example of cycloaddition reaction is the dielsalder reaction the socalled 42 cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system whether or not a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds  cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat  these perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects  for example the 42 dielsalder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the 22 cycloaddition is selectively induced by light  because of the orbital character the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited as described by the woodwardhoffmann rules biochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes  these proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction so that reactions can be controlled very precisely the reaction takes place in the active site a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization the catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape induced fit bond strain proximity and orientation of molecules relatively to the enzyme proton donation or withdrawal acidbase catalysis electrostatic interactions and many others the biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism  among the most important its mechanisms is the anabolism in which different dna and enzymecontrolled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units  bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions an important energy sources is glucose which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food  all organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate atp which can then be used to energise other reactions chemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores it is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents energy inputs and waste  catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate some specific reactions have their niche applications  for example the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding  although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxyfuel welding arc welding and flash welding it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails especially in remote areas mechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate  relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients  important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of ph and analysis of optical absorption color and emission spectra a less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body  faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows shortlived transition states to be monitored  at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds', 'cellbiology knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences  appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as to biomedical fields such as cancer research and developmental biology  these fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme sometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types  hence research in cell biology is closely related to genetics biochemistry molecular biology immunology and developmental biology each type of protein is usually sent to a particular part of the cell an important part of cell biology is the investigation of molecular mechanisms by which proteins are moved to different places inside cells or secreted from cells most proteins are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm  this process is known as protein biosynthesis  biosynthesis also called biogenesis is an enzymecatalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products also simply known as protein translation some proteins such as those to be incorporated in membranes known as membrane proteins are transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum er during synthesis  this process can be followed by transportation and processing in the golgi apparatus  from the golgi membrane proteins can move to the plasma membrane to other subcellular compartments or they can be secreted from the cell the er and golgi can be thought of as the membrane protein synthesis compartment and the membrane protein processing compartment respectively  there is a semiconstant flux of proteins through these compartments  er and golgiresident proteins associate with other proteins but remain in their respective compartments  other proteins flow through the er and golgi to the plasma membrane  motor proteins transport membrane proteincontaining vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks to distant parts of cells such as axon terminals some proteins that are made in the cytoplasm contain structural features that target them for transport into mitochondria or the nucleus some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for by mitochondrial dna in plants chloroplasts also make some cell proteins extracellular and cell surface proteins destined to be degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into endocytosed vesicles some of which fuse with lysosomes where the proteins are broken down to their individual amino acids the degradation of some membrane proteins begins while still at the cell surface when they are cleaved by secretases  proteins that function in the cytoplasm are often degraded by proteasomes several different techniques exist to study cells purification may be performed using the following methods', 'colonnafamily the colonna family was a powerful italian noble family in medieval and renaissance rome supplying one pope and many other church and political leaders  their family is notable for their bitter feud with the orsini family over influence in rome until it was stopped by papal bull in 1511 in 1571 the chiefs of both families married nieces of pope sixtus v according to tradition the colonna are a branch of the counts of tusculum  by peter 10991151 son of gregory iii called peter de columna from his property the columna castle in colonna alban hills the first cardinal from the family was appointed in 1206 when giovanni colonna di carbognano was made cardinal deacon of ss cosma e damiano for many years cardinal giovanni di san paolo elevated in 1193 was identified as member of the colonna family and therefore its first representative in the college of cardinals but modern scholars have established that this was based on the false information from the beginning of 16th century at this time a rivalry began with the propapal orsini family leaders of the guelph faction  this reinforced the proemperor ghibelline course that the colonna family followed throughout the period of conflict between the papacy and the holy roman empire in 1297 cardinal jacopo giacomo colonna disinherited his brothers ottone matteo and landolfo of their lands the latter three appealed to pope boniface viii who ordered jacopo to return the land and furthermore hand over the familys strongholds of colonna palestrina and other towns to the papacy jacopo refused in may boniface removed him from the college of cardinals and excommunicated him and his followers for four generations the colonna family aside from the three brothers allied with the pope declared that boniface had been elected illegally following the unprecedented abdication of pope celestine v three years previously the dispute lead to open warfare and in september boniface appointed landolfo to the command of his army to put down the revolt of landolfos own colonna relatives  this he did and by the end of 1298 colonna palestrina and other towns had been captured and razed to the ground the familys lands were distributed among landolfo and his loyal brothers the rest of the family fled italy family enmity with pope boniface viii led to destruction of the fortress at palestrina and to the seizure of the pope at anagni by sciarra colonna in 1303  sciarra apparently smacked the pope publicily in his face it was he who in old age crowned louis iv of bavaria as holy roman emperor in 1328  in honor of this event the colonna family was granted the privilege of using the imperial pointed crown on top of their coat of arms the family remained at the centre of civic and religious life throughout the late middle ages in 1248 after having dedicated her entire life to serving god and the poor margherita colonna died a member of the franciscan order she was beatified by pope pius ix in 1848 in the 14th century the family sponsored the decoration of the church of san giovanni most notably the floor mosaics   in 1314 cardinal egidio colonna died at avignon now in france where the popes had withdrawn an augustinian he had studied theology in paris under st thomas of aquinas to become one of the most authoritative thinkers of his time and tutor to french king philip iv the fair 1268  29 november 1314   the celebrated poet petrarch was a great friend of the family often living in rome as a guest of the family he composed a number of sonnets for special occasions within the colonna family including colonna the glorious the great latin name upon which all our hopes rest in 1627 anna colonna daughter of don filippo colonna married taddeo barberini of the barberini nephew of pope urban viii in 1728 the carbognano branch colonna di sciarra of the colonna family added the name barberini to its family name  when giulio cesare colonna di sciarra married cornelia barberini daughter of the last male barberini to hold the name and granddaughter of maffeo barberini son of taddeo barberini the colonna family

with its ordinary topology  this space is not compact in a sense points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right it is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single point at infinity which we will denote by  the resulting compactification can be thought of as a circle which is compact as a closed and bounded subset of the euclidean plane  every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to  in this compactification intuitively the process can be pictured as follows first shrink the real line to the open interval  on the xaxis then bend the ends of this interval upwards in positive ydirection and move them towards each other until you get a circle with one point the topmost one missing  this point is our new point  at infinity adding it in completes the compact circle a bit more formally we represent a point on the unit circle by its angle in radians going from  to  for simplicity   identify each such point  on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line tan2   this function is undefined at the point  since tan2 is undefined there we will identify this point with our point  since tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous our identification function is a homeomorphism between the real line and the unit circle without  what we have constructed is called the alexandroff onepoint compactification of the real line discussed in more generality below it is also possible to compactify the real line by adding two points  and  this results in the extended real line an embedding of a topological space x as a dense subset of a compact space is called a compactification of x it is often useful to embed topological spaces in compact spaces because of the special properties compact spaces have embeddings into compact hausdorff spaces may be of particular interest  since every compact hausdorff space is a tychonoff space and every subspace of a tychonoff space is tychonoff we conclude that any space possessing a hausdorff compactification must be a tychonoff space   in fact the converse is also true being a tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a hausdorff compactification the fact that large and interesting classes of noncompact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology for any topological space x the alexandroff onepoint compactification alphax of x is obtained by adding one extra point  often called a point at infinity and defining the open sets of the new space to be the open sets of x together with the sets of the form gu where g is an open subset of x such that x  g is closed and compact the onepoint compactification of x is hausdorff if and only if x is hausdorff and locally compact of particular interest are hausdorff compactifications ie compactifications in which the compact space is hausdorff a topological space has a hausdorff compactification if and only if it is tychonoff in this case there is a unique up to homeomorphism most general hausdorff compactification the stoneech compactification of x denoted by x formally this exhibits the category of compact hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a reflective subcategory of the category of tychonoff spaces and continuous maps the stoneech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows let c be the set of continuous functions from x to the closed interval 01   then each point in x can be identified with an evaluation function on c thus x can be identified with a subset of 01c the space of all functions from c to 01   since the latter is compact by tychonoffs theorem the closure of x as a subset of that space will also be compact   this is the stoneech compactification real projective space rpn is a compactification of euclidean space rn  for each possible direction in which points in rn can escape one new point at infinity is added but each direction is identified with its opposite the alexandroff onepoint compactification of r we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to rp1  note however that the projective plane rp2 is not the onepoint compactification of the plane r2 since more than one point is added complex projective space cpn is also a compactification of  cn the alexandroff onepoint compactification of the plane c is homeomorphic to the complex projective line cp1 which in turn can be identified with a sphere the riemann sphere passing to projective space is a common tool in algebraic geometry because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems  for example any two different lines in rp2 intersect in precisely one point a statement that is not true in r2  more generally bzouts theorem which is fundamental in intersection theory holds in projective space but not affine space  this distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in algebraic topology in the cohomology rings  the cohomology of affine space is trivial while the cohomology of projective space is nontrivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory dimension and degree of a subvariety with intersection being poincar dual to the cup product compactification of moduli spaces generally require allowing certain degeneracies  for example allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties this is notably used in the delignemumford compactification of the moduli space of algebraic curves in the study of discrete subgroups of lie groups the quotient space of cosets is often a candidate for more subtle compactification to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological for example modular curves are compactified by the addition of single points for each cusp making them riemann surfaces and so since they are compact algebraic curves  here the cusps are there for a good reason the curves parametrize a space of lattices and those lattices can degenerate go off to infinity often in a number of ways taking into account some auxiliary structure of level the cusps stand in for those different directions to infinity that is all for lattices in the plane  in ndimensional euclidean space the same questions can be posed for example about sonslnrslnz  this is harder to compactify  there are a variety of compactifications such as the borelserre compactification the reductive borelserre compactification and the satake compactifications that can be formed', 'clade a clade is a group consisting of an organism and all its descendants  in the terms of biological systematics a clade is a single branch on the tree of life the idea that such a natural group of organisms should be grouped together and given a taxonomic name is central to biological classification  in cladistics which takes its name from the term clades are the only acceptable units the term was coined in 1958 by english biologist julian huxley a clade is termed monophyletic meaning it contains one ancestor which can be an organism population or species and all its descendants a semantic case has been made that the name should be holophyletic but this term has not yet acquired widespread use  for more information see holophyly three methods of defining clades are featured in phylogenetic nomenclature node stem and apomorphybased in linnaean taxonomy clades are defined by a set of traits apomorphies unique to the group  this system is basically similar to the apomorphybased clades of phylogenetic nomenclature the difference is one of weight  while phylogenetic nomenclature bases the group on an ancestor with a certain trait linnaean taxonomy uses the traits themselves to define the group in cladistics the clade is a hypothetical construct based on experimental data  clades are found using multiple sometimes hundreds of traits from a number of species or specimens and analysing them statistically to find the most likely phylogenetic tree for the group  although similar in some ways to a biological classification of species the method is statistical and more open to scrutiny than traditional methods  although taxonomists use clades as a tool in classification where feasible the taxonomic tree of life is not the same as the cladistic the traditional genus family etc names are not necessarily clades though they will often be in linnaean systematics the various groups are ordered into a series of taxonomic ranks the familiar order family etc  these ranks will by convention dictate the ending to names for some groups  clades do not by their nature fit this scheme and no such restriction exists as to their names in cladistics  there is however a convention for naming more or less inclusive groups which are given prefixes like crown or pan see crown group the idea of a clade did not exist in predarwinian linnaean taxonomy which was based only on morphological similarities between organisms  although it happens that many of the better known animal groups in linnaeus original systema naturae notably among the vertebrate groups do represent clades  with the publication of darwins theory of evolution in 1859 taxonomy gained a theoretical basis and the idea was born that groups used in a system of classification should represent branches on the evolutionary tree of life  in the century and a half since then taxonomists have worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution  however partly because the tree of life branches rather unevenly the hierarchy of the linnaean system does not always lend itself well to representing clades the result is that when it comes to naming cladistics and linnaean taxonomy are not always compatible  in particular higher level taxa in linnaean taxonomy often represent evolutionary grades rather than clades resulting in groups made up of clades where one or two subbranches have been excluded  typical examples include bony fishes which include the ancestor of tetrapods and reptiles ancestral to both birds and mammals in phylogenetic nomenclature clades can be nested at any level and do not have to be slotted into a small number of ranks in an overall hierarchy  in contrast the linnaean units of order class etc must be used when naming a new taxon  as there are only seven formal levels to the linnaean system species being the lowest only a finite number of sub and superunits can be created  in order to be able to use the full complexity of taxonomic trees cladograms in an area with which they are very familiar some researchers have opted to dispense with ranks all together instead using clade names without linnaean ranks the reason for preferring one system over the other is partly one of application cladistic trees give details suitable for specialists the linnaean system gives a well ordered overview at the expense of details of the phylogenetic tree in a few instances the linnaean system has actually impeded our understanding of the phylogeny and broad evolutionary patterns the best known example is the interpretation of the strange fossils of the burgess shale and the subsequent idea of a cambrian explosion with the application of cladistics and the rejection of any significance of the concept of phyla the confusion of the late 20th century over the burgess animals has been resolved it appears there never was an explosion of major bauplans with subsequent extinctions the seemingly weird critters themselves have been found to be representatives of a group the lobopodia that includes arthropods water bears and velvet worms in most instances the two systems are not at odds however the cladistic statement that the clade lobopodia contains among others the arthropoda tardigrada and onychophora is factually identical to the linnaean evolutionary statement that the group lobopodia is ancestral to the phyla arthropoda tardigrada and onychophora the difference is one of semantics rather than phylogeny', 'eupatent the eu patent or european union patent formerly known as the community patent european community patent or ec patent  and sometimes abbreviated as compat is a patent law measure being debated within the european union which would allow individuals and companies to obtain a unitary patent throughout the european union the eu patent should not be confused with european patents which are granted under the european patent convention european patents once granted become a bundle of nationally enforceable patents in the designated states  this can be expensive for both patentees and third parties in that enforcement must be carried out through national courts in individual countries and revocation cannot be accomplished centrally once the ninemonth opposition period has expired the eu patent is intended to solve these problems and also to provide a patent right that is consistent across europe thus fulfilling one of the key principles of the internal market in that the same market conditions should exist wherever in europe trade is carried out  different patent rights in different countries presents a distortion of this principle in view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent other legal agreements have been proposed outside the european union legal framework to reduce the cost of translation of patents when granted and litigation namely the london agreement which entered into force on may 1 2008and which has reduced the number of countries requiring translation of european patents granted nowadays under the european patent convention and the corresponding costs to obtain a european patent and the european patent litigation agreement epla which is as of 2010 only a proposal work on a community patent started in the 1970s but the resulting community patent convention cpc was a failure the luxembourg conference on the community patent took place indeed in 1975 and the convention for the european patent for the common market or luxembourg community patent convention cpc was signed at luxembourg on december 15 1975 by the 9 member states of the european economic community at that time  however the cpc never entered into force it was not ratified by enough countries fourteen years later the agreement relating to community patents done at luxembourg on december 15 1989 was an attempt to revive the project  this agreement consisted in an amended version of the original community patent convention but this attempt failed again  twelve states signed the agreement ie  belgium denmark france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal spain and united kingdom but only seven ratified it ie  denmark france germany greece luxembourg the netherlands and united kingdom all states would need to ratify the agreement to cause it to enter into force nevertheless as a minor consolation a majority of member states of the eec at that time introduced some harmonisation into their national patent laws in anticipation of the entry in force of the cpc a more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the european patent convention and the strasbourg convention in 2000 renewed efforts from the european union resulted in a community patent regulation proposal sometimes abbreviated as cpr it provides that the patent once it has been granted by the european patent office epo in one of its procedural languages english german or french and published in that language with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages will be valid without any further translation  this proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs nevertheless additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer  in such a situation a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the member state in which he is domiciled is presumed until proven otherwise not to have knowingly infringed the patent  in order to protect a suspected infringer who in such a situation has not acted in a deliberate manner it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer the proposed community patent regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents thus a community patents validity will be the same in all eu member states  this court will be attached to the present european court of justice and court of first instance through use of provisions in the treaty of nice discussion regarding the community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on march 3 2003  however one year later in march 2004 under the irish presidency the competitiveness council failed to agree on the details of the regulation in particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an infringement remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble after the council in march 2004 eu commissioner frits bolkestein said that the failure to agree on the community patent i am afraid undermines the credibility of the whole enterprise to make europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010  jonathan todd commissions internal market spokesman declared european commission president romano prodi asked to evaluate his fiveyear term cites as his weak point the failure of many eu governments to implement the lisbon agenda agreed in 2001  in particular he cited the failure to agree on a europewide patent or even the languages to be used for such a patent because member states did not accept a change in the rules they were not coherent there is support for the community patent from various quarters  from the point of view of the european commission the community patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the european union for smaller businesses if the community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area then there is also support  for larger businesses however other issues come into play which have tended to dilute overall support  in general these businesses recognise that the current european patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement the community patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed european patent court a business would be reluctant to obtain a europewide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge  also the question of translations would not go away  unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement it was understood that larger businesses the bulk of the users of the patent system would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested european patent  thus in 2005 the community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future  however on january 16 2006 the european commission launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an euwide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders needs the community patent was one of the issues the consultation focused on  more than 2500 replies were received in february 2007 eu commissioner charlie mccreevy was quoted as saying the european commission released a white paper in april 2007 seeking to improve the patent system in europe and revitalise the debate on this issue in october 2007 the portuguese presidency of the council of the european union proposed a eu patent jurisdiction borrowing heavily from the rejected draft european patent litigation agreement epla in november 2007 eu ministers were reported to have made some progress towards a community patent legal system with some specific results expected in 2008 in 2008 the idea of using machine translations to translate patents was proposed to solve the language issue which is partially responsible for blocking progress on the community patent  meanwhile european commissioner for enterprise and industry gnter verheugen declared at the european patent forum in may 2008 that there was an urgent need for a community patent in december 2009 it was reported that the swedish eu presidency had achieved a breakthrough in negotiations concerning the community patent the breakthrough was reported to involve setting up a single patent court for the eu however ministers conceded much work remained to be done before the community patent would become a reality according to the agreed plan the eu will accede to the european patent convention as a contracting state and patents granted by the european patent office will when validated for the eu have unitary effect in the territory of the european union as of july 2010 the issue of the language regime to adopt was still being debated  on november 10 2010 it was announced that no agreement had been reached and that in spite of the progress made the competitiveness council of the european union had fallen short of unanimity by a small margin with commentators reporting that the spanish representative citing the aim to avoid any discrimination had reiterated at length the stubborn rejection of the madrid government of taking the munich three languages regime english german french of the european patent convention epc as a basis for a future eu patent in december 2010 an enhanced cooperation was proposed in order to set up a unitary patent applicable in all the european union countries that would support it  according to the financial times such procedure is rare and has been used only once in the past', 'cache in computer engineering a cache k kash in us and ke kaysh in austnz is a component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster the data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere if requested data is contained in the cache cache hit this request can be served by simply reading the cache which is comparatively faster  otherwise cache miss the data has to be recomputed or fetched from its original storage location which is comparatively slower  hence the more requests can be served from the cache the faster the overall system performance is as opposed to a buffer which is managed explicitly by a client a cache stores data transparently this means that a client who is requesting data from a system is not aware that the cache exists which is the origin of the name cache from french cacher to conceal to be cost efficient and to enable an efficient use of data caches are relatively small  nevertheless caches have proven themselves in many areas of computing because access patterns in typical computer applications have locality of reference  references exhibit temporal locality if data is requested again that has been recently requested already  references exhibit spatial locality if data is requested that is physically stored close to data that has been requested already hardware implements cache as a block of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again  cpus and hard drives frequently use a cache as do web browsers and web servers a cache is made up of a pool of entries  each entry has a datum a nugget of data  a copy of the same datum in some backing store  each entry also has a tag which specifies the identity of the datum in the backing store of which the entry is a copy when the cache client a cpu web browser operating system needs to access a datum presumed to exist in the backing store it first checks the cache if an entry can be found with a tag matching that of the desired datum the datum in the entry is used instead  this situation is known as a cache hit  so for example a web browser program might check its local cache on disk to see if it has a local copy of the contents of a web page at a particular url in this example the url is the tag and the contents of the web page is the datum the percentage of accesses that result in cache hits is known as the hit rate or hit ratio of the cache the alternative situation when the cache is consulted and found not to contain a datum with the desired tag has become known as a cache miss the previously uncached datum fetched from the backing store during miss handling is usually copied into the cache ready for the next access during a cache miss the cpu usually ejects some other entry in order to make room for the previously uncached datum the heuristic used to select the entry to eject is known as the replacement policy  one popular replacement policy least recently used lru replaces the least recently used entry see cache algorithms  more efficient caches compute use frequency against the size of the stored contents as well as the latencies and throughputs for both the cache and the backing store  while this works well for larger amounts of data long latencies and slow throughputs such as experienced with a hard drive and the internet it is not efficient for use with a cpu cache when a system writes a datum to the cache it must at some point write that datum to the backing store as well the timing of this write is controlled by what is known as the write policy in a writethrough cache every write to the cache causes a synchronous write to the backing store alternatively in a writeback or  writebehind cache writes are not immediately mirrored to the store  instead the cache tracks which of its locations have been written over and marks these locations as dirty the data in these locations are written back to the backing store when those data are evicted from the cache an effect referred to as a lazy write  for this reason a read miss in a writeback cache which requires a block to be replaced by another will often require two memory accesses to service one to retrieve the needed datum and one to write replaced data from the cache to the store other policies may also trigger data writeback the client may make many changes to a datum in the cache and then explicitly notify the cache to write back the datum this avoids the need for writeback or writethrough when the old value of the datum was absent from the cache prior to the write entities other than the cache may change the data in the backing store in which case the copy in the cache may become outofdate or stale  alternatively when the client updates the data in the cache copies of those data in other caches will become stale  communication protocols between the cache managers which keep the data consistent are known as coherency protocols small memories on or close to the cpu can operate faster than the much larger main memory  most cpus since the 1980s have used one or more caches and modern highend embedded desktop and server microprocessors may have as many as half a dozen each specialized for a specific function   examples of caches with a specific function are the dcache and icache data cache and instruction cache while cpu caches are generally managed entirely by hardware a variety of software manages other caches the page cache in main memory which is an example of disk cache is managed by the operating system kernel while the hard drives hardware disk buffer is sometimes misleadingly referred to as disk cache its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching  repeated cache hits are relatively rare due to the small size of the buffer in comparison to the drives capacity  however highend disk controllers often have their own onboard cache of hard disk data blocks finally fast local hard disk can also cache information held on even slower data storage devices such as remote servers web cache or local tape drives or optical jukeboxes  such a scheme is the main concept of hierarchical storage management web browsers and web proxy servers employ web caches to store previous responses from web servers such as web pages  web caches reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted across the network as information previously stored in the cache can often be reused  this reduces bandwidth and processing requirements of the web server and helps to improve responsiveness for users of the web web browsers employ a builtin web cache but some internet service providers or organizations also use a caching proxy server which is a web cache that is shared among all users of that network another form of cache is p2p caching where the files most sought for by peertopeer applications are stored in an isp cache to accelerate p2p transfers there are three kinds of web caches the bind dns daemon caches a mapping of domain names to ip addresses as does a resolver library writethrough operation is common when operating over unreliable networks like an ethernet lan because of the enormous complexity of the coherency protocol required between multiple writeback caches when communication is unreliable  for instance web page caches and clientside network file system caches like those in nfs or smb are typically readonly or writethrough specifically to keep the network protocol simple and reliable search engines also frequently make web pages they have indexed available from their cache  for example google provides a cached link next to each search result  this can prove useful when web pages from a web server are temporarily or permanently inaccessible another type of caching is storing computed results that will likely be needed again or  memoization ccache a program that caches the output of the compilation to speed up the secondtime compilation exemplifies this type database caching can substantially improve the throughput of database applications for example in the processing of indexes data dictionaries and frequently used subsets of data distributed caching the terms buffer and cache are not mutually exclusive and the functions are frequently combined however there is a difference in intent a buffer is a temporary memory location that is traditionally used because cpu instructions cannot directly address data stored in peripheral devices  thus addressable memory is used as intermediate stage  additionally such a buffer may be feasible when a large block of data is assembled or disassembled as required by a storage device or when data may be delivered in a different order than that in which it is produced  also a whole buffer of data is usually transferred sequentially for example to hard disk so buffering itself sometimes increases transfer performance or reduce the variation or jitter of the transfers latency as opposed to caching where the intent is to reduce the latency  these benefits are present even if the buffered data are written to the buffer once and read from the buffer once a cache also increases transfer performance a part of the increase similarly comes from the possibility that multiple small transfers will combine into one large block but the main performancegain occurs because there is a good chance that the same datum will be read from cache multiple times or that written data will soon be read a caches sole purpose is to reduce accesses to the underlying slower storage  cache is also usually an abstraction layer that is designed to be invisible from the perspective of neighbouring layers', 'contextswitch a context switch is the computing process of storing and restoring state context of a cpu so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time  this enables multiple processes to share a single cpu the context switch is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system   context switches are usually computationally intensive and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use there are three situations where a context switch needs to occur they are most commonly within some scheduling scheme one process needs to be switched out of the cpu so another process can run  within a preemptive multitasking operating system the scheduler allows every task to run for some certain amount of time called its time slice if a process does not voluntarily yield the cpu for example by performing an io operation a timer interrupt fires and the operating system schedules another process for execution instead  this ensures that the cpu cannot be monopolized by any one processorintensive application modern architectures are interrupt driven  this means that if the cpu requests data from a disk for example it does not need to busywait until the read is over it can issue the request and continue with some other execution when the read is over the cpu can be interrupted and presented with the read  for interrupts a program called an interrupt handler is installed and it is the interrupt handler that handles the interrupt from the disk the kernel services the interrupts in the context of the interrupted process even though it may not have caused the interrupt the interrupted process may have been executing in user mode or in kernel mode the kernel saves enough information so that it can later resume execution of the interrupted process and services the interrupt in kernel mode the kernel does not spawn or schedule a special process to handle interrupts when a transition between user mode and kernel mode is required in an operating system a context switch is not necessary a mode transition is not by itself a context switch   however depending on the operating system a context switch may also take place at this time in a switch the state of the first process must be saved somehow so that when the scheduler gets back to the execution of the first process it can restore this state and continue the state of the process includes all the registers that the process may be using especially the program counter plus any other operating system specific data that may be necessary  this data is usually stored in a data structure called a process control block pcb or switchframe now in order to switch processes the pcb for the first process must be created and saved the pcbs are sometimes stored upon a perprocess stack in kernel memory as opposed to the usermode stack or there may be some specific operating system defined data structure for this information since the operating system has effectively suspended the execution of the first process it can now load the pcb and context of the second process  in doing so the program counter from the pcb is loaded and thus execution can continue in the new process  new processes are chosen from a queue or queues  process and thread priority can influence which process continues execution with processes of the highest priority checked first for ready threads to execute context switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware some processors like the intel 80386 and higher cpus have hardware support for context switches by making use of a special data segment designated the task state segment or tss when a task switch occurs implicitly due to a call instruction referring to a task gate or explicitly due to an interrupt or exception the cpu can automatically load the new state from the tss with other tasks performed in hardware one would expect this to be rather fast however mainstream operating systems including windows and linux do not use this feature  this is due mainly to two reasons that hardware context switching does not save all the registers only general purpose registers not floating point registersalthough the ts bit is automatically turned on in the cr0 control register resulting in a fault when executing floating point instructions and giving the os the opportunity to do saving and restoring of the floating point state and associated performance issues the extreme case is the barrel processor architecture which switches between threads of execution on every cycle', 'concept a concept abstract term conception is a cognitive unit of meaningan abstract idea or a mental symbol sometimes defined as a unit of knowledge built from other units which act as a concepts characteristics a concept is typically associated with a corresponding representation in a language or symbology such as a single meaning of a term there are prevailing theories in contemporary philosophy which attempt to explain the nature of concepts the representational theory of mind proposes that concepts are mental representations while the semantic theory of concepts originating with freges distinction between concept and object holds that they are abstract objects  ideas are taken to be concepts although abstract concepts do not necessarily appear to the mind as images as some ideas do  many philosophers consider concepts to be a fundamental ontological category of being the meaning of concept is explored in mainstream cognitive science metaphysics and philosophy of mind the term concept is traced back to 155460 latin conceptum  something conceived but what is today termed the classical theory of concepts is the theory of aristotle on the definition of terms john lockes description of a general idea corresponds to a description of a concept  according to locke a general idea is created by abstracting drawing away or removing the common characteristic or characteristics from several particular ideas  this common characteristic is that which is similar to all of the different individuals  for example the abstract general idea or concept that is designated by the word red is that characteristic which is common to apples cherries and blood the abstract general idea or concept that is signified by the word dog is the collection of those characteristics which are common to airedales collies and chihuahuas in the same tradition as locke john stuart mill stated that general conceptions are formed through abstraction a general conception is the common element among the many images of members of a classwhen we form a set of phenomena into a class that is when we compare them with one another to ascertain in what they agree some general conception is implied in this mental operation a system of logic book iv ch ii mill did not believe that concepts exist in the mind before the act of abstraction it is not a law of our intellect that in comparing things with each other and taking note of their agreement we merely recognize as realized in the outward world something that we already had in our minds the conception originally found its way to us as the result of such a comparison it was obtained in metaphysical phrase by abstraction from individual things ibid for schopenhauer empirical conceptsare mere abstractions from what is known through intuitive perception and they have arisen from our arbitrarily thinking away or dropping of some qualities and our retention of others  parerga and paralipomena vol i sketch of a history of the ideal and the real in his on the will in nature physiology and pathology schopenhauer said that a concept is drawn off from previous images by putting off their differences  this concept is then no longer intuitively perceptible but is denoted and fixed merely by words  nietzsche who was heavily influenced by schopenhauer wrote  every concept originates through our equating what is unequal  no leaf ever wholly equals another and the concept leaf is formed through an arbitrary abstraction from these individual differences through forgetting the distinctions by contrast to the above philosophers immanuel kant held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct he called those concepts that result of abstraction a posteriori concepts meaning concepts that arise out of experience an empirical or an a posteriori concept is a general representation vorstellung or nonspecific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects logic i 1 1 note 1 a concept is a common feature or characteristic  kant investigated the way that empirical a posteriori concepts are created kants description of the making of a concept has been paraphrased asto conceive is essentially to think in abstraction what is common to a plurality of possible instances  hj paton kants metaphysics of experience i 250  in his discussion of kant christopher janaway wrotegeneric concepts are formed by abstraction from more than one species kant declared that human minds possess pure or a priori concepts  instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions like empirical concepts they originate in the mind itself he called these concepts categories in the sense of the word that means predicate attribute characteristic or quality but these pure categories are predicates of things in general not of a particular thing  according to kant there are 12 categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects  each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts  in order to explain how an a priori concept can relate to individual phenomena in a manner analogous to an a posteriori concept kant employed the technical concept of the schema it seems intuitively obvious that concepts must have some kind of structure  up until recently the dominant view of conceptual structure was a containment model associated with the classical view of concepts  according to this model a concept is endowed with certain necessary and sufficient conditions in their description which unequivocally determine an extension the containment model allows for no degrees a thing is either in or out of the concepts extension  by contrast the inferential model understands conceptual structure to be determined in a graded manner according to the tendency of the concept to be used in certain kinds of inferences  as a result concepts do not have a kind of structure that is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions all conditions are contingent margolis5 however some theorists claim that primitive concepts lack any structure at all  for instance jerry fodor presents his asymmetric dependence theory as a way of showing how a primitive concepts content is determined by a reliable relationship between the information in mental contents and the world  these sorts of claims are referred to as atomistic because the primitive concept is treated as if it were a genuine atom in cognitive linguistics abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience the mechanism of transformation is structural mapping in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space fauconnier  turner 1995 see conceptual blending a common class of blends are metaphors  this theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions or recollections in platos term of an independently existing world of ideas in that it denies the existence of any such realm it also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept and not abstracted away  while the perspective is compatible with jamesian pragmatism above the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation a long and wellestablished tradition philosophy posits that philosophy itself is nothing more than conceptual analysis  this view has its proponents in contemporary literature as well as historical  according to deleuze and guattaris what is philosophy 1991 philosophy is the activity of creating concepts  this creative activity differs from previous definitions of philosophy as simple reasoning communication or contemplation of universals  concepts are specific to philosophy science creates functions and art sensations a concept is always signed thus descartes cogito or kants transcendental it is a singularity not universal and connects itself with others concepts on a plane of immanence traced by a particular philosophy  concepts can jump from one plane of immanence to another combining with other concepts and therefore engaging in a becomingother concepts are vital to the development of scientific knowledge  for example it would be difficult to imagine physics without concepts like energy force or acceleration  concepts help to integrate apparently unrelated observations and phenomena into viable hypotheses and theories the basic ingredients of science the concept map is a tool that is used to help researchers visualize the interrelationships between various concepts although the mainstream literature in cognitive science regards the concept as a kind of mental particular it has been suggested by some theorists that concepts are real things margolis8  in most radical form the realist about concepts attempts to show that the supposedly mental processes are not mental at all rather they are abstract entities which are just as real as any mundane object plato was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts  by his view concepts and ideas in general are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world  in this way universals were explained as transcendent objects  needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with platos ontological projects  this remark on plato is not of merely historical interest  for example the view that numbers are platonic objects was revived by kurt gdel as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts gottlob frege founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference  for him the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world namely the way that some object is presented  since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept and frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world  accordingly concepts as senses have an ontological status morgolis7 according to carl benjamin boyer in the introduction to his the history of the calculus and its conceptual development concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions  as long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible they are accepted on their own  for example the concepts of the derivative and the integral are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience  neither are they related in any way to mysterious limits in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence that is coming into or going out of appearance or existence the abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common essential attributes remained concepts as abstract units of meaning play a key role in the development and testing of theories  for example a simple relational hypothesis can be viewed as either a conceptual hypothesis where the abstract concepts form the meaning or an operationalized hypothesis which is situated in the real world by rules of interpretation  for example take the simple hypothesis education increases income the abstract notion of education and income concepts could have many meanings a conceptual hypothesis cannot be tested they need to be converted into operational hypothesis or the abstract meaning of education must be derived or operationalized to something in the real world that can be measured  education could be measured by years of school completed or highest degree completed etc  income could be measured by hourly rate of pay or yearly salary etc the system of concepts or conceptual framework can take on many levels of complexity  when the conceptual framework is very complex and incorporates causality or explanation they are generally referred to as a theory  noted philosopher of science carl gustav hempel says this more eloquently an adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory  the hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena  frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between the conceptual framework and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested interpreted framework the whole system floats as it were above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation  these might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation  by virtue of those interpretative connections the network can function as a scientific theory a concept is a system of general ideas targeting the multilateral treatmentinterpretation of economic social legal scientific technical and other problems and reflecting the manner of perception or the multitude of opinions ideas regarding problems associated with to the development of one or several fields or sectors as a whole', 'communityemergencyresponseteam in the united states a community emergency response team cert can refer to sometimes programs and organizations take different names such as neighborhood emergency response team nert or neighborhood emergency team net the concept of civilian auxiliaries is similar to civil defense which has a longer history the cert concept differs because it includes nonmilitary emergencies and is coordinated with all levels of emergency authorities local to national via an overarching incident command system the concept of widespread local volunteer emergency responders was implemented and developed by the los angeles fire department in 1985  the whittier narrows earthquake of 1987 showed the need for preparing citizens to take care of themselves and their loved ones after a disasterhttpwwwcitizencorpsgovcertaboutshtm in the 1989 loma prieta earthquake residents of san franciscos marina district help run lengths of fire hose from a fireboat to firefighters ashore after the hydrant system failed  later the fire department worked with the community to form the citys nert program neighborhood emergency response teamhttpwwwsfgovorgsitesfnertindexasp by 1993 the federal emergency management agency had made the program available nationwide by 2003 cert programs were offered in 45 states httpwwwdhsgovdhspublicdisplaytheme15content835 cert and citizen corps were transferred to the office of domestic preparedness now the office of grants and training in august 2004 a local government agency often a fire department or emergency management agency agrees to sponsor cert within its jurisdiction the sponsoring agency liases with deploys and may train or supervise the training of cert members the sponsoring agency receives and disburses federal and state citizen corps grant funds allocated to its cert program  many sponsoring agencies employ a fulltime communityservice person as liaison to the cert members  in some communities the liaison is a volunteer and cert member as people are trained and agree to join the community emergency response effort a cert is formed  initial efforts may result in a team with only a few members from across the community  as the number of members grow a single communitywide team may subdivide  multiple certs are organized into a hierarchy of teams consistent with ics principles  this follows the incident command system ics principle of span of control until the ideal distribution is achieved one or more teams are formed at each neighborhood within a community some certs form a club or service corporation and recruit volunteers to perform training on behalf of the sponsoring agency  this reduces the financial and human resource burden on the sponsoring agency when not responding to disasters certs may some sponsoring agencies use citizen corps grant funds to purchase response tools and equipment for their members and teams subject to stafford act limitations  most certs also acquire their own supplies tools and equipment  as community members certs are aware of the specific needs of their community and equip the teams accordingly the basic idea is to use cert to perform the large number of tasks needed in emergencies  this frees highly trained professional responders for more technical tasks  much of cert training concerns the incident command system and organization so cert members fit easily into larger command structures a team may selfactivate selfdeploy when their own neighborhood is affected by disaster an effort is made to report their response status to the sponsoring agency a selfactivated team will sizeup the loss in their neighborhood and begin performing the skills they have learned to minimize further loss of life property and environment they will continue to respond safely until redirected or relieved by the sponsoring agency or professional responders onscene teams in neighborhoods not affected by disaster may be deployed or activated by the sponsoring agency the sponsoring agency may communicate with neighborhood cert leaders through an organic communication team  in some areas the communications may be by amateur radio frs gmrs or murs radio dedicated telephone or firealarm networks  in other areas relays of bicycleequipped runners can effectively carry mail between the teams and the local emergency operations center the sponsoring agency may activate and dispatch teams in order to gather or respond to intelligence about an incident   teams may be dispatched to affected neighborhoods or organized to support operations  cert members may augment support staff at an incident command post or emergency operations center additional teams may also be created to guard the morgue locate supplies and food convey messages to and from other cert teams and local authorities and other duties on an asneeded basis as identified by the team leader in the short term certs perform data gathering especially to locate masscasualties requiring professional response or situations requiring professional rescues simple firefighting tasks eg small fires turning off gas light search and rescue damage evaluation of structures triage and first aid  in the longer term certs may assist in the evacuation of residents or assist with setting up a neighborhood shelter while responding cert members are temporary volunteer government workers  in some areas such as california and kansas registered activated cert members are eligible for workers compensation for onthejob injuries during declared disasters the federal emergency management agency fema recommends that the standard tenperson team be comprised as follows because every cert member in a community receives the same core instruction any team member has the training necessary to assume any of these roles  this is important during a disaster response because not all members of a regular team may be available to respond  hasty teams may be formed by whichever members are responding at the time   additionally members may need to adjust team roles due to stress fatigue injury or other circumstances while state and local jurisdictions will implement training in the manner that best suits the community the citizen corps cert program has an established curriculum  jurisdictions may augment the training but are strongly encouraged to deliver the entire core content the citizen corps cert core curriculum for the basic course is composed of the following nine units time is instructional hours citizen corps cert training emphasizes safely doing the most good for the most people as quickly as possible when responding to a disaster  for this reason cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr training is not included in the core curriculum as it is time and responderintensive  however many jurisdictions encourage or require cert members to obtain cpr training each unit of citizen corps cert training is ideally delivered by professional responders or other experts in the field addressed by the unit  this is done to help build unity between cert members and responders keep the attention of students and help the professional response organizations be comfortable with the training which cert members receive each course of instruction is ideally facilitated by one or more instructors certified in the cert curriculum by the state or sponsoring agency  facilitating instructors provide continuity between units and help ensure that the cert core curriculum is being delivered successfully  facilitating instructors also perform setup and teardown of the classroom provide instructional materials for the course record student attendance and other tasks which assist the professional responder in delivering their unit as efficiently as possible citizen corps cert training is provided free to interested members of the community and is delivered in a group classroom setting  people may complete the training without obligation to join a cert citizen corps grant funds can be used to print and provide each student with a printed manual some sponsoring agencies use citizen corps grant funds to purchase disaster response tool kits  these kits are offered as an incentive to join a cert and must be returned to the sponsoring agency when members resign from cert because uniformed volunteer disaster responders are accorded a higher level of trust than unaffiliated volunteers when responding in a disaster many sponsoring agencies require a criminal backgroundcheck of all trainees before allowing them to participate on a cert the citizen corps cert curriculum including the trainthetrainer course was updated during the last half of 2008 to reflect feedback from instructors across the nation the update is in final review and is scheduled for release during the first quarter of 2009 the sponsoring agency the citizen corps council if one exists and the cert members themselves work to promote awareness of the program in the community and recruit new members most effective programs run a program on a very predictable schedule so civilians can locate the training  for example one effective format has a fourhour training program on the first saturday morning of each month about 1 of adults will train simply because the training is available  more will train if the area is prone to periodic disasters or the government effectively recruits publicservice groups and schools  civilians are recruited with advertising in schools businesses parks recreation programs libraries and openhouses for fire and police departments cert participation becomes much wider if the recruiting and training is made into a social occasion  one of the best social recruiting methods is to ask trainees to go doortodoor in their neighborhoods  this mobilizes cert trainees to establish neighborhood teams  typically the volunteer distributes flyers that offer a yard party on a patriotic holiday and then hosts it the classic way to recruit a neighborhood team is to offer food on a patriotic occasion  flyers or pamphlets at the meeting give the training schedules the social occasion gives people a place to meet and lets interested persons find each other and organize the first step of each training meeting is always to register attendees a notice and newsletter is mailed or emailed to previous attendees to arrive just before the next training session the city also uses attendance to certify people giving the city a database of trained volunteers during registration the trainee gets a name tag with a colored dot or group number the cert organization may run a lottery to encourage attendance the tickets are given at registration the premiums are given after the training and may include items purchased by the government tools or supplies as well as commercial promotional offerings from local businesses such as free lunches or sample products after this the group splits into parts assigned by the colored dots on their badges and trains  having several training groups permits large groups to use facilities in rotation with lectures and demonstrations topics for a weekend training session usually include need for disaster preparedness fire safety and fire extinguisher use first aid and triage logistics and communication sheltering search and rescue and team organization after the training the lots are drawn and the premiums are distributed more information httpwwwtrainingfemagovemiwebcertnewcertindexhtm starting and

line one of the factors leading to its creation was that the area around croydon has no underground service tramlink runs on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic dedicated track in public roads and offstreet track consisting of new rightsofway former railway lines and one section of alignment though not track shared with a third rail electrified network rail line in 1990 croydon council with the then london regional transport lrt put the project to parliament and the croydon tramlink act 1994 resulted which gave lrt the legal power to build and run tramlink in 1996 tramtrack croydon limited tcl won a 99 year private finance initiative pfi contract to design build operate and maintain the tramlink system  under this contract tramtrack croydon ltd kept the revenue generated by tramlink and lrt had to pay compensation to tcl for any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced later tcl subcontracted the operation of the tram system to centrewest buses now part of first london tcl was a partnership comprising first group bombardier transportation the builders of the systems tramcars sir robert mcalpine and amey construction ltd who built the system and royal bank of scotland and 3i who arranged the finances route 2 runs parallel to the crystal palace to beckenham junction line of the southern network between birkbeck and beckenham junction the national rail track had been singled some years earlier from elmers end to woodside route 1 and also route 2 from arena take part of the former british rail branch line to addiscombe then diverges to reach addiscombe tram stop which is 500 metres west of the now demolished railway station  at woodside the old station buildings still stand disused and the original platforms have been replaced by accessible low platforms from woodside to near sandilands routes 1  2 and from near sandilands almost to lloyd park route 3 tramlink follows the former woodside and south croydon railway including the park hill or sandilands tunnels the section of route 3 between wimbledon and west croydon follows the old singletrack british rail route for the most part which was closed on 31 may 1997 so that it could be converted for tramlink within this section from near phipps bridge to near reeves corner route 3 follows the surrey iron railway this gives tramlink a claim to the worlds oldest aligned trackbed  beside mitcham tram stop had its name long before tramlink a partial obstruction of the route near this point has necessitated the use of gauntlet track a victorian footbridge beside waddon new road was dismantled to make way for the flyover that takes tramlink over the west croydon to sutton railway line the footbridge has been reerected at corfe castle station on the swanage railway in march 2008 tfl announced that it had reached agreement to buy tramtrack croydon limited tcl for 98m the purchase was finalised on 28 june 2008  the background to this purchase relates to the requirement that tfl who took over from london regional transport in 2000 compensates tcl for the consequences of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since 1996  in 2007 that payment was 4m with an annual increase in rate in october 2008 tfl introduced a new colour scheme to the vehicles using the blue white and green of the routes symbol on tfl maps to distinguish the trams from its buses operating in the area the tram stops have low platforms convert35 above rail level  stops are unstaffed and have automated ticket machines for ticket sales  in general access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing there are 39 tram stops most being convert322 long they are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than convert2  this allows for wheelchairs prams pushchairs and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps  in street sections the pavement is integrated with the tram stop tramlink uses some former mainline stations on the wimbledonwest croydon and elmers endcoombe road stretches of line that were taken over the railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to tramlink specifications except at elmers end and wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher platforms to enable crossplatform interchange thirty eight stops opened as part of the phased introduction of tram services in may 2000  centrale tram stop in tamworth road opened on 10 december 2005 increasing journey times slightly  as turnround times are already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality  partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services subsequently introduced in july 2006 tfl had issued tenders for a new tram  however nothing resulted from this all stops have disabled access raised paving cctv a passenger help point a passenger information display pid litter bins a ticket machine a noticeboard and lampposts and most also have seats and a shelter the pids display the destination and expected arrival times of the next two trams they can also display any message the controllers want to display such as information on delays or even direct instructions to vandals to stop placing objects on the track tramlink is not shown on the standard tube map but is shown on the london connections map the original route structure was line 1 wimbledon to elmers end line 2 croydon to beckenham junction and line 3 croydon to new addington on 23 july 2006 the route network was restructured with route 1 from elmers end to croydon and route 2 from beckenham junction to croydon running every 10 minutes monday  saturday daytime every 30 minutes at other times and route 3 from new addington to wimbledon every 75 minutes monday  saturday daytime every 15 minutes at other times since being taken over by tfl all routes have a maximum service interval of fifteen minutes service during all operational hours when transport for london took over operation and ownership a new network map was designed combining routes 1 and 2 as one service coloured trams green lime  originally line 1 was coloured yellow line 2 was red and line 3 was a darker district line green as part of the tfl network all tfl bus passes are valid on tramlink  as are travelcards that include any of zones 3 4 5 and 6 cash fares and payasyougo oyster card fares are the same as on london buses although special fares may apply when using tramlink feeder buses when using oyster cards passengers must touch in on the platform before boarding the tram  special arrangements apply at wimbledon station where the tramlink stop is located within the national rail and london underground station tramlink is operated with articulated low floor flexity swift cr4000 trams built by bombardier transportation in vienna  the tramlink fleet is 24 strong with four more trams planned  to avoid the extra costs of a short production run tramlink is seeking to lease these from edinburgh trams where the construction of new track and depot is facing long delays but the rolling stock is due for delivery from early in 2010  the edinburgh tram will be manufactured by caf of spain to accommodate the extra capacity some sections of singletrack line may be doubled the trams are numbered beginning at 2530 continuing from the highestnumbered tram number 2529 on londons former tram network which closed in 1952 all trams have now been refurbished including a repaint into a new livery the mayors transport strategy for london states that extensions to the tramlink network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements and where tramlink technology might be cost effective  proposal 4d7 says that the mayor will explore the potential for extending the tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the transport strategy cost effectively  and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002 an initial review of potential tramlink extensions has been prepared and discussed with interested parties  tfl now wishes to carry out initial development and evaluation work on the following routes other extension proposals include lewisham bromley town centre biggin hill airportvillage and a local spurloop to penetrate further into purley way retailindustrial park starting in the west there are two corridors that suggest bringing tramlink to sutton town centre the first of these proposing operations principally between wimbledon and sutton has been in view even before tramlink opened  indeed presumptuously the trams were delivered with destination displays for this as line 4 already included on blind sets tramlink route 4 was the only extension being formally developed the proposed route linked harrington road stop with crystal palace and crystal palace directly with beckenham junction both terminating at crystal palace parade there were three options on how to get to the parade onstreet offstreet and a mixture of the two  following recent consultation the offstreet option is favoured with trams running along existing railway as far as crystal palace station and then running round the western edge of crystal palace park within the current parks perimeter to the bus terminus near the parade  tfl have currently stated that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward but also say that they are committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to government the sutton to wimbledon proposal utilises the existing tramlink infrastructure between wimbledon and morden road stop the cramped tram terminus inside wimbledon station is barely adequate for its present function if another service is to arrive at wimbledon a new terminus will need to be created  diverging from the present croydon route the sutton line might adopt segregated alignment within the highway along morden road serving morden station interchange it would probably use aberconway road to reach morden hall road before using the spacious st helier avenue as the direct route to st helier rose hill st helier hospital is an important local traffic objective that tramlink ought to serve despite the need to deviate from the direct route into sutton via angel hill a number of variants in sutton town centre are to be examined to see how the shopping centre station and office complex can be accessed the alignment is presently served by a number of busy bus services and if built would give tramlink patrons direct interchange with the northern line at morden a southtoeast curve may also be considered at morden road to permit direct operations that link st helier to mitcham and croydon the other sutton proposal  to tooting  is more ambitious and undoubtedly contains many more challenges than suttonwimbledon link  apart from workshopdepot facilities and a curve required to link the line into the existing system this extension would share no infrastructure with the existing tramlink were line 4 to be realised ahead of this proposal the tooting line would of course then have the st helier to sutton section in common  north of st helier the alignment is likely to fit across parkland and open space to take in the willow lane industrial estate before serving mitcham town centre some commonality would be enjoyed here with the short separate proposal to provide a spur from mitcham junction to mitcham town centre  from here the tooting projection would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre section before sharing carriageway with all traffic in the part of london road south of figges marsh with room for segregation beyond the junction with streatham road the most difficult leg arises immediately the mertonwandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching tooting broadway from this point will stir much debate to the north and south of croydon are some busy bus corridors which themselves derive from earlier tram routes  these include the purley  croydon  streatham corridor which is proposed for conversion to tram operation to the south of croydon the proposal is for the new route to diverge from the existing central croydon loop and use a highway alignment probably using south end and brighton road to purley beyond purley an extension to coulsdon will be investigated  as this would be close to the m23 motorway a possibility would be the construction of a park and ride site  however finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of purley where brighton road carries the heavy traffic of the a23 trunk road to the north of croydon it is again proposed to use a highway alignment based on london road to the south of thornton heath pond the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility  north of this point the road becomes the a23 again but there are likely to be some opportunities for trambaan type segregation to norbury and between norbury and streatham although norbury itself is a pinch point the proposal is to terminate the line at streatham railway station providing an interchange to the extended east london line work currently commissioned will also check out proposals to extend tramlink to biggin hill bromley town centre lewisham and purley way if initial examination shows promise further work could follow to firm up more detailed routings for these proposals the onboard announcements in a male voice are made by bbc news reader and tram enthusiast nicholas owen', 'cholistandesert the word cholistan is derived from the turkish word chol which means desert cholistan thus means land of the desert the people of cholistan lead a seminomadic life moving from one place to another in search of water and fodder for their animals the dry bed of the hakra river runs through the area along which many settlements of the indus valley civilisation have been found the desert also has an annual jeep rally known as cholistan desert jeep rally it is the biggest motor sports event in pakistan the language of cholistan also reflects a number of features of its historical and geographical background the saraiki language is an indoaryan speech and is spoken in cholistan as well as in a large part of central pakistan though once a neglected language it is no more a neglected  once attributed to the cameldriving jats and seminude baloch tribes it has always been as orthodox and conservative as the people who speak it   khwaja ghulam farid was a sufi poet who through his mystical writings and poetry not only developed the language a lot but also gave it a boost the language suffered a great loss when the saraikispeaking hindus migrated to india during the partition and were replaced by the muslim refugees from there  however the majority of them lived in the cities and a very few in the greater cholistan during the partition they moved to the safety of the neighboring hindu states of bikaner and jaisalmar in a harsh and barren land where rainfall is very sparse and unreliable cholistanis rely mainly on their livestock of sheep goats and camel  however in cold nights of winter they huddle indoor and engage themselves in various arts and crafts such as textiles weaving leatherwork and pottery as mentioned above the indus valley has always been occupied by the wandering nomadic tribes who are fond of isolated areas as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures  cholistan till the era of mughal rule had also been isolated from outside influence  during the rule of mughal emperor akbar it became a proper productive unit the entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers the rulers were the great patrons of art and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development influencing each other   mesons stone carvers artisans artists and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites and with that flourished new courts paintings weaving and pottery the fields of architecture sculpture terra cotta and pottery developed greatly in this phase the backbone of cholistan economy is cattle breeding it has the major importance for satisfying the areas major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat  because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale milked or shorn for their wool  moreover isolated as they were they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food clothing and all the items of daily use  so all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well the estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 16 million cholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of pakistan from this wool they knit beautiful carpets rugs and other woolen items  this includes blankets which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat but winter nights here are very cold usually below freezing points  khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton  khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base  cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit it may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of indus valley civilization  various kinds of khaddarcloth are made for local consumption and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here a beautiful cloth called sufi is also woven of silk and cotton or with cotton wrap and silk wool  gargas are made with numerous patterns and color having complicated embroidery mirror and patchwork  ajrak is another specialty of cholistan it is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth  cotton turbans and shawls are also made here  chunri is another form of dopattas having innumerable colors and patterns like dots squares and circles on it camels are highly valued by the desert dwellers  camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile  camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs the camels leather is also utilized in making kuppies goblets and expensive lampshades leatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here  other than the products mentioned above khusa shoes is a specialty of this area  cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship variety and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads the cholistanis are fond of jewellery and have a craze for gold the chief ornaments made and worn by them are nathnose gay katmalanecklace kanganbracelet pazeb anklets and chandanhar etc gold and silver bangles are also made and worn with pride the locals are experts in enamel works and it is done on buttons of all sorts earrings bangles and rings etc the great desert though considered to be colorless and drab is not wholly devoid of color  its green portion plays the role of color belt especially after rains when vegetation growth is at its peak  adding to that the locals always wear brightly colored clothes mostly consisting of brilliant reds blazing oranges shocking pinks and startling yellows and greens  even the cloth trappings of their bullocks and camels are richly colored and highly textured the indus civilization was the earliest center of ceramics and thus the pottery of cholistan has a long history  local soil is very fine thus most suitable for making pottery the fineness of the earth can be observed on the kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like white cemented the chief cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies piyalas and glasses remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing in the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed but from the seventh century onwards a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities the building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples  in fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts villas palaces havelis gateways fortifications and city walls', 'cartography the fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to modern cartography is closely integrated with geographic information science giscience and constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of geographic information systems the earliest known map is a matter of some debate both because the definition of map is not sharp and because some artifacts speculated to be maps might actually be something else a wall painting which may depict the ancient anatolian city of atalhyk previously known as catal huyuk or atal hyk has been dated to the late 7th millennium bce other known maps of the ancient world include the minoan house of the admiral wall painting from c 1600 bce showing a seaside community in an oblique perspective and an engraved map of the holy babylonian city of nippur from the kassite period 14th 12th centuries bce the oldest surviving world maps are the babylonian world maps from the 9th century bce one shows babylon on the euphrates surrounded by a circular landmass showing assyria urartu and several cities in turn surrounded by a bitter river oceanus with seven islands arranged around it  another depicts babylon as being further north from the center of the world the ancient greeks and romans created maps beginning at latest with anaximander in the 6th century bc in the 2nd century ad ptolemy produced his treatise on cartography geographia this contained ptolemys world map   the world then known to western society ecumene as early as the 8th century arab scholars were translating the works of the greek geographers into arabic in ancient china geographical literature spans back to the 5th century bc the oldest extant chinese maps come from the state of qin dated back to the 4th century bc during the warring states period in the book of the xin yi xiang fa yao published in 1092 by the chinese scientist su song a star map on the equidistant cylindrical projection  although this method of charting seems to have existed in china even prior to this publication and scientist the greatest significance of the star maps by su song is that they represent the oldest existent star maps in printed form early forms of cartography of india included the locations of the pole star and other constellations of use mappa mundi is the general term used to describe medieval european maps of the world  approximately 1100 mappae mundi are known to have survived from the middle ages of these some 900 are found illustrating manuscripts and the remainder exist as standalone documents the arab geographer muhammad alidrisi produced his medieval atlas tabula rogeriana in 1154  he incorporated the knowledge of africa the indian ocean and the far east gathered by arab merchants and explorers with the information inherited from the classical geographers to create the most accurate map of the world up until his time it remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries in the age of exploration from the 15th century to the 17th century european cartographers both copied earlier maps some of which had been passed down for centuries and drew their own based on explorers observations and new surveying techniques the invention of the magnetic compass telescope and sextant enabled increasing accuracy  in 1492 martin behaim a german cartographer made the oldest extant globe of the earth johannes werner refined and promoted the werner map projection  in 1507 martin waldseemller produced a globular world map and a large 12panel world wall map universalis cosmographia bearing the first use of the name america portuguese cartographer diego ribero was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated equator 1527  italian cartographer battista agnese produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts due to the sheer physical difficulties inherent in cartography mapmakers frequently lifted material from earlier works without giving credit to the original cartographer  for example one of the most famous early maps of north america is unofficially known as the beaver map published in 1715 by herman moll this map is an exact reproduction of a 1698 work by nicolas de fer de fer in turn had copied images that were first printed in books by louis hennepin published in 1697 and franois du creux in 1664  by the 18th century mapmakers started to give credit to the original engraver by printing the phrase after the original cartographer on the work in cartography technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users the first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment therefore varied in quality and were limited in distribution the advent of magnetic devices such as the compass and much later magnetic storage devices allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to store and manipulate them digitally advances in mechanical devices such as the printing press quadrant and vernier allowed for the mass production of maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions from more accurate data  optical technology such as the telescope sextant and other devices that use telescopes allowed for accurate surveying of land and the ability of mapmakers and navigators to find their latitude by measuring angles to the north star at night or the sun at noon advances in photochemical technology such as the lithographic and photochemical processes have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear  this also eliminated the need for engraving which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps advances in electronic technology in the 20th century ushered in another revolution in cartography  ready availability of computers and peripherals such as monitors plotters printers scanners remote and document and analytic stereo plotters along with computer programs for visualization image processing spatial analysis and database management have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps the ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials  see also digital raster graphic these days most commercialquality maps are made using software that falls into one of three main types  cad gis and specialized illustration software  spatial information can be stored in a database from which it can be extracted on demand  these tools lead to increasingly dynamic interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally with the field rugged computers gps and laser rangefinders it is possible to perform mapping directly in the terrain the construction of the map in real time improve productivity and quality of the result  real time mapping is done for example with fieldmap technology in understanding basic maps the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories general cartography and thematic cartography  general cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features  general maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series  for example the 124000 scale topographic maps of the united states geological survey usgs are a standard as compared to the 150000 scale canadian maps the government of the uk produces the classic 150000 replacing the older 1inch to 1 mile ordnance survey maps of the entire uk and with a range of correlated larger and smallerscale maps of great detail thematic cartography involves maps of specific geographic themes oriented toward specific audiences a couple of examples might be a dot map showing corn production in indiana or a shaded area map of ohio counties divided into numerical choropleth classes  as the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial cultural and social data an orienteering map combines both general and thematic cartography designed for a very specific user community the most prominent thematic element is shading that indicates degrees of difficulty of travel due to vegetation the vegetation itself is not identified merely classified by the difficulty fight that it presents a topographic map is primarily concerned with the topographic description of a place including especially in the 20th century the use of contour lines showing elevation  terrain or relief can be shown in a variety of ways see cartographic relief depiction a topological map is a very general type of map the kind you might sketch on a napkin it often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information  becks london underground map is an iconic example  though the most widely used map of the tube it preserves little of reality  it varies scale constantly and abruptly it straightens curved tracks and it contorts directions haphazardly the only topography on it is the river thames letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river  that and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space  yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know so the map fulfills its purpose arthur h robinson an american cartographer influential in thematic cartography stated that a map not properly designed will be a cartographic failure he also claimed when considering all aspects of cartography that map design is perhaps the most complex  robinson codified the mapmakers understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs from the very beginning of mapmaking maps have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes the intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion the term percipient refers to the person receiving information and was coined by robinson the principle of figureground refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map  this will enhance the users experience and keep his attention if the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion the map may be regarded as useless making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal  alan maceachren explains that a well designed map is convincing because it implies authenticity 1994 pp9 an interesting map will no doubt engage a reader  information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map  showing several variables allows comparison which adds to the meaningfulness of the map  this also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research  in order to convey the message of the map the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose the title of a map may provide the needed link necessary for communicating that message but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it monmonier 1993 pp93 in the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the human body to the virtual worlds of cyberspace  therefore there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map  for example one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by public transport organisations to guide passengers namely urban rail and metro maps many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by harry beck and george dow most maps use text to label places and for such things as a map title legend and other information  maps are often made in specific languages though names of places often differ between languages  so a map made in english may use the name germany for that country while a german map would use deutschland and a french map allemagne a word that describes a place using a nonnative terminology or language is referred to as an exonym in some cases the proper name is not clear  for example the nation of burma officially changed its name to myanmar but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use burma sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use  examples include the use of saigon for ho chi minh city bangkok for krung thep and ivory coast for cte divoire difficulties arise when transliteration or transcription between writing systems is required  national names tend to have well established names in other languages and writing systems such as russia for  but for many placenames a system of transliteration or transcription is required  in transliteration the symbols of one language are represented by symbols in another  for example the cyrillic letter  is traditionally written as r in the latin alphabet  systems exist for transliteration of arabic but the results may vary  for example the yemeni city of mocha is written variously in english as mocha al mukha almukh mocca and moka transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another  chinese writing is transformed into the latin alphabet through the pinyin phonetic transcription systems  other systems were used in the past such as wadegiles resulting in the city being spelled beijing on newer english maps and peking on older ones further difficulties arise when countries especially former colonies do not have a strong national geographic naming standard  in such cases cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed sometimes resented colonial names some countries have multiple official languages resulting in multiple official placenames  for example the capital of belgium is both brussel and bruxelles in canada english and french are official languages and places have names in both languages  british columbia is also officially named la colombiebritannique english maps rarely show the french names outside of quebec which itself is spelled qubec in french the study of placenames is called toponymy while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is etymology in order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places the iconic example of this practice is lance wymans early plans for the mexico city metro on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos  wyman also prototyped such a map for the washington metro though ultimately the idea was rejected  other cities experimenting with such maps are fukuoka guadalajara and monterrey the quality of a maps design affects its readers ability to extract information and to learn from the map  cartographic symbology has been developed in an effort to portray the world accurately and effectively convey information to the map reader a legend explains the pictorial language of the map known as its symbology the title indicates the region the map portrays the map image portrays the region and so on  although every map element serves some purpose convention only dictates inclusion of some elements while others are considered optional a menu of map elements includes the neatline border compass rose or north arrow overview map bar scale projection and information about the map sources accuracy and publication when examining a landscape scale can be intuited from trees houses and cars  not so with a map  even such a simple thing as a north arrow is crucial it may seem obvious that the top of a map should point north but this might not be the case color likewise is equally important  how the cartographer displays the data in different hues can greatly affect the understanding or feel of the map  different intensities of hue portray different objectives the cartographer is attempting to get across to the audience  today personal computers can display up to 16 million distinct colors at a time jeer 1997  this fact allows for a multitude of color options for even for the most demanding maps  moreover computers can easily hatch patterns in colors to give even more options  this is very beneficial when symbolizing data in categories such as quintile and equal interval classifications quantitative symbols give a visual measure of the relative sizeimportancenumber that a symbol represents and to symbolize this data on a map there are two major classes of symbols used for portraying quantitative properties  proportional symbols change their visual weight according to a quantitative property  these are appropriate for extensive statistics  choropleth maps portray data collection areas such as counties or census tracts with color  using color this way the darkness and intensity or value of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration harvard graduate school of design 2005 a good map has to provide a compromise between portraying the items of interest or themes in the right place for the map scale used against the need to annotate that item with text or a symbol which takes up space on the map medium and very likely will cause some other item of interest to be displaced the cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place  because of the demands of the annotation  this issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller ie the map shows a larger area because relatively the annotation on the map takes up more space on the ground a good example from the late 1980s was the ordnance surveys first digital maps where the absolute positions of major roads shown at scales of 11250 and 12500 were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth when shown on digital maps at scales of 1250000 and 1625000 because of the overriding need to annotate the features some maps contain deliberate errors or distortions either as propaganda or as a watermark helping the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors maps the latter often come in the form of nonexistent misnamed or misspelled trap streets  other names and forms for this are paper townsites fictitious entries and copyright easter eggs another motive for deliberate errors is simply cartographic graffiti or prank a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work  mount richard for example was a fictitious peak on the rocky mountains continental divide that appeared on a boulder county colorado map in the early 1970s it is believed to be the work of drafts man richard ciacci the fiction was not discovered until two years later see maps for more links to modern and historical maps however most of the largest sites are listed at the sites linked below', 'hanukkah the festival is observed by the kindling of the lights of a unique candelabrum the ninebranched menorah or hanukiah one additional light on each night of the holiday progressing to eight on the final night the typical menorah consists of 8 branches with an additional raised branch the extra light is called a shamash hebrew  attendant or sexton  and is given a distinct location usually above or below the rest the purpose of the shamash is to have a light available for use as using the hanukkah lights themselves is forbidden hanukkah is mentioned in the deuterocanonical or apocrypha books of 1 maccabees and 2 maccabees 1 maccabees states  for eight days they celebrated the rededication of the altar  then judah and his brothers and the entire congregation of israel decreed that the days of the rededication should be observed every year for eight days 1 mac 45659 according to 2 maccabees the jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as on the feast of booths  the name hanukkah derives from the hebrew verb  meaning to dedicate  on hanukkah the jews regained control of jerusalem and rededicated the temple many homiletical explanations have been given for the name the story of hanukkah along with its laws and customs is entirely missing from the mishna apart from several passing references bikkurim 16 rosh hashanah 13 taanit 210 megillah 34 and 36 moed katan 39 and bava kama 66    rav nissim gaon postulates in his hakdamah lemafteach hatalmud that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the mishna felt no need to explain it  reuvein margolies suggests that as the mishnah was redacted after the bar kochba revolt its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler for fear of antagonizing the romans hanukkah is described in the talmud the gemara in tractate shabbat 21 focuses on shabbat candles and moves to hanukkah candles and says that after the forces of antiochus iv had been driven from the temple the maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned they found only a single container that was still sealed by the high priest with enough oil to keep the menorah in the temple lit for a single day they used this yet it burned for eight days the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready the talmud presents three options except in times of danger the lights were to be placed outside ones door on the opposite side of the mezuza or in the window closest to the street  rashi in a note to shabbat 21b says their purpose is to publicize the miracle the ancient jewish historian flavius josephus narrates in his book jewish antiquities xii how the victorious judas maccabbeus ordered lavish yearly eightday festivities after rededicating the temple in jerusalem that had been profaned by antiochus iv epiphanes josephus does not say the festival was called hannukkah but rather the festival of lights the story of hanukkah is alluded to in the book of 1 maccabees and 2 maccabees but hanukkah is not specially mentioned rather a story similar in character and obviously older in date is the one alluded to in 2 maccabees 118 et seq according to which the relighting of the altar fire by nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the twentyfifth of kislev and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by judah maccabee another source is the megillat antiochus this work also known as megillat hahasmonaim megillat hanukkah or megillat yevanit is in both aramaic and hebrew the hebrew version is a literal translation from the aramaic original  recent scholarship dates it to somewhere between the 2nd and 5th centuries probably in the 2nd century with the hebrew dating to the seventh century it was published for the first time in mantua in 1557  saadia gaon who translated it into arabic in the 9th century ascribed it to the maccabees themselves disputed by some since it gives dates as so many years before the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce the hebrew text with an english translation can be found in the siddur of philip birnbaum the christian bible refers to jesus being at the jerusalem temple during the feast of the dedication and it was winter in john 102223 judea was part of the ptolemaic kingdom of egypt until 200 bce when king antiochus iii the great of syria defeated king ptolemy v epiphanes of egypt at the battle of panium judea became at that moment part of the seleucid empire of syria king antiochus iii the great wanting to conciliate his new jewish subjects guaranteed their right to live according to their ancestral customs and to continue to practice their religion in the temple of jerusalem however in 175 bce antiochus iv epiphanes the son of antiochus iii invaded judea ostensibly at the request of the sons of tobias when the second temple in jerusalem was looted and the services stopped judaism was effectively outlawed  in 167 bce antiochus ordered an altar to zeus erected in the temple he banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple antiochuss actions proved to be a major miscalculation as they were massively disobeyed and provoked a largescale revolt  mattathias a jewish priest and his five sons jochanan simeon eleazar jonathan and judah led a rebellion against antiochus judah became known as yehuda hamakabi judah the hammer by 166 bce mattathias had died and judah took his place as leader  by 165 bce the jewish revolt against the seleucid monarchy was successful the temple was liberated and rededicated  the festival of hanukkah was instituted by judah maccabee and his brothers to celebrate this event  after recovering jerusalem and the temple judah ordered the temple to be cleansed a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made  according to the talmud olive oil was needed for the menorah in the temple which was required to burn throughout the night every night the story goes that there was only enough oil to burn for one day yet it burned for eight days the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah  jews believe that this was a miracle an eight day festival was declared by the jewish sages to commemorate this miracle the version of the story in 1 maccabees on the other hand states that an eight day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon rededication of the altar and makes no mention of the miracle of the oil a number of historians believe that the reason for the eight day celebration was that the first hanukkah was in effect a belated celebration of the festivals of sukkot and shemini atzeret during the war the jews were not able to celebrate sukkotshemini atzeret properly the combined festivals also last eight days and the sukkot festivities featured the lighting of lamps in the temple sukv 24 it has also been noted that the number eight has special significance in jewish theology as representing transcendence and the jewish peoples special role in human history  seven is the number of days of creation that is of completion of the material cosmos  eight being one step beyond seven represents the infinite hence the eighth day of the assembly festival mentioned above is according to jewish law a festival for jews only unlike sukkot when all peoples were welcome in jerusalem similarly the rite of brit milah circumcision which brings a jewish male into gods covenant is performed on the eighth day  hence hanukkahs eight days in celebration of monotheism over hellenistic humanism have symbolic importance for practicing jews some modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the traditionalist jews and the hellenized jews in jerusalem these competed violently over who would be the high priest with traditionalists with hebrewaramaic names like onias contesting with hellenizing high priests with greek names like jason and menelaus in particular jasons hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of judaism other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war what began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the hellenistic kingdom of syria sided with the hellenizing jews in their conflict with the traditionalists hanukkah is celebrated by a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8day holiday some are familybased and others communal  there are special additions to the daily prayer service and a section is added to the blessing after meals  hanukkah is not a sabbathlike holiday and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the sabbath as specified in the shulkhan arukh adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall  there is no religious reason for schools to be closed although in israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of hanukkah many families exchange gifts each night and fried foods are eaten the single light each night for eight nights  as a universally practiced beautification of the mitzvah the number of lights lit is increased by one each night an extra light called a shamash meaning attendant or sexton so all together including the shamash two lights are lit on the first night three on the second and so on ending with nine on the last night for a total of 44 36 excluding the shamash the lights can be candles or oil lamps the reason for the hanukkah lights is not for the lighting of the house within but rather for the illumination of the house without so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holidays miracle  accordingly lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street it is customary amongst some ashkenazim to have a separate menorah for each family member customs vary whereas most sephardim light one for the whole household  only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view as was the case in persia under the rule of the zoroastrians or in parts of europe before and during world war ii however most hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway not necessarily in public view  according to this tradition the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah so that when one passes through the door he is surrounded by the holiness of mitzvoth hanukkah lights should burn for at least one half hour after it gets dark the custom of the vilna gaon observed by many residents of jerusalem as the custom of the city is to light at sundown although most hassidim light later even in jerusalem many hasidic rebbes light much later because they fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their hasidim when they kindle the lights  inexpensive small wax candles sold for hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so on most days this requirement can be met by lighting the candles when it is dark outside  friday night presents a problem however  since candles may not be lit on the shabbat itself the candles must be lit before sunset  however they must remain lit until the regular timethirty minutes after nightfalland inexpensive hanukkah candles do not burn long enough to meet the requirement a simple solution is to use longer candles or the traditional oil lamps  in keeping with the abovestated prohibition the hanukkah menorah is lit first followed by the shabbat candles which signify its onset typically three blessings brachot singular brachah are recited during this eightday festival  on the first night of hanukkah jews recite all three blessings on all subsequent nights they recite only the first two the blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition  on the first night of hanukkah one light candle lamp or electric is lit on the right side of the menorah on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first candle and so on proceeding from right to left over the eight nights  on each night the leftmost candle is lit first and lighting proceeds from left to right for the full text of the blessings see list of jewish prayers and blessings  hanukkah during or after the lights are kindled the hymn hanerot halalu is recited  there are several differing versions the version presented here is recited in many ashkenazic communities each night after the lighting of the candles while remaining within sight of the candles some observant ashkenazim and in recent decades some sephardim and mizrahim in western countries sing the hymn maoz tzur written in medieval germany the song contains six stanzas the first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation and the middle four deal with events of persecution in jewish history and praises god for survival despite these tragedies the exodus from egypt the babylonian captivity the miracle of the holiday of purim and the hasmonean victory after lighting the candles and maoz tzur singing various other hanukkah songs is customary in many jewish homes  various hasidic and sephardic traditions have additional prayers that are recited both before and after lighting the hanukkah lights  this includes the recitation of many psalms most notably psalms 30 67 and 91 many hasidim recite psalm 91 seven times after lighting the lamps as was taught by the baal shem tov as well as other prayers and hymns each congregation according to its own custom  in north america and in israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time  in addition many families encourage their children to give tzedakah for at least one of the nights in lieu of presents for themselves an addition is made to the hodaah thanksgiving benediction in the amidah called al hanissim onabout the miracles this addition refers to the victory achieved over the syrians by the hasmonean mattathias and his sons the same prayer is added to the grace after meals  in addition the hallel psalms are sung during each morning service and the tachanun penitential prayers are omitted the torah is read every day in the synagogue the first day beginning from numbers 622 according to some customs numbers 71 and the last day ending with numbers 84  since hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one and sometimes two jewish sabbaths saturdays the weekly torah portion for the first sabbath is almost always miketz telling of josephs dream and his enslavement in egypt the haftarah reading for the first sabbath hanukkah is zechariah 21447  when there is a second sabbath on hanukkah the haftarah reading is from i kings 74050  the hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings the menorah is not lit on the sabbath but rather prior to the beginning of the sabbath at night and not at all during the day during the middle ages megillat antiochus was read in the italian synagogues on hanukkah just as the book of esther is read on purim it still forms part of the liturgy of the yemenite jews the last day of hanukkah is known as zot hanukkah from the verse read on this day in the synagogue numbers 784 zot chanukat hamizbeach this was the dedication of the altar  according to the teachings of kabbalah and hasidism this day is the final seal of the high holiday season of yom kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for god in this spirit many hasidic jews wish each other gmar chatimah tovah may you be sealed totally for good a traditional greeting for the yom kippur season it is taught in hasidic and kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers generally women are exempt in jewish law from time bound positive commandments however the talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting hanukkah candles for they too were involved in the miracle  this account of judiths involvement with the events of chanukah serves to explain the requirement of women to participate in the rituals of hanukkah and the origins of the custom of eating dairy during the holiday the classical rabbis downplayed the military and nationalistic dimensions of hanukkah and some even interpreted the emphasis upon the story of the miracle oil as a diversion away from the struggle with empires that had led to the disastrous downfall of jerusalem to the romans with the advent of zionism and the state of israel these themes were reconsidered  in modern israel the national and military aspects of hanukkah became once again more dominant in north america especially hanukkah gained increased importance with many jewish families in the latter half of the twentieth century including large numbers of secular jews who wanted a jewish alternative to the christmas celebrations that often overlap with hanukkah though it was traditional among ashkenazi jews to give gelt or money coins to children during hanukkah in many families this has changed into gifts in order to prevent jewish children from feeling left out of the christmas gift giving while hanukkah traditionally speaking is a relatively minor jewish holiday as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles in north america hanukkah has taken a place equal to passover as a symbol of jewish identity  both the israeli and north american versions of hanukkah emphasize resistance focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday there are several songs associated with the festival of hanukkah the most well known in englishspeaking countries include dreidel dreidel dreidel and chanukah oh chanukah in israel hanukkah has become something of a national holiday a large number of songs have been written on hanukkah themes perhaps more so than for any other jewish holiday some of the best known are hanukkiah li yesh i have a hanukkah menora ocho kandelikas eight little candles kad katan a small jug svivon sov sov sov dreidel spin and spin haneirot halolu these candles which we light mi yimalel who can retell and ner li ner li i have a candle there is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil preferably olive oil as the original miracle of the hanukkah menorah involved the discovery of a small flask of pure olive oil used by the jewish high priest the kohen gadol this small batch of olive oil was only supposed to last one day and instead it lasted eight accordingly potato pancakes known as latkes in yiddish are traditionally associated with hanukkah especially among ashkenazi families as they are prepared by frying in oil similarly many sephardic polish and israeli families have the custom of eating all kinds of jamfilled doughnuts  pontshkes bimuelos fritters and sufganiyot which are deepfried in oil  bakeries in israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling including chocolate cream vanilla cream cappucino and others  in recent years there have also appeared downsized mini sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular 400to600calorie version there is also a tradition of eating cheese products on hanukkah that is recorded in rabbinic literature  this custom is seen as a commemoration of the involvement of judith and thus women in the events of hanukkah see judith and holofernes above the dreidel or sevivon in hebrew is a foursided spinning top that children play with on hanukkah each side is imprinted with a hebrew letter  these letters are an acronym for the hebrew words     nes gadol haya sham a great miracle happened there referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the beit hamikdash on many dreidels sold in israel the fourth side is inscribed with the letter  pe rendering the acronym     nes gadol haya po a great miracle happened here referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of israel stores in haredi neighbourhoods sell the traditional shin dreidels as well some jewish commentators ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel  one commentary for example connects the four letters with the four exiles to which the nation of israel was historically subject  babylonia persia greece and rome after lighting the hanukkah menorah it is customary in many homes to play the dreidel game  each player starts out with 10 or 15 coins real or of chocolate nuts raisins candies or other markers and places one marker in the pot the first player spins the dreidel and depending on which side the dreidel falls on either wins a marker from the pot or gives up part of his stash the code based on a yiddish version of the game is as follows another version differs the game may last until one person has won everything some say the dreidel game is played to commemorate a game devised by the jews to camouflage the fact that they were studying torah which was outlawed by greeks the jews would gather in caves to study posting a lookout to alert the group to the presence of greek soldiers if soldiers were spotted the jews would hide their scrolls and spin tops so the greeks thought they were gambling not learning hanukkah gelt yiddish for money is often distributed to children to enhance their enjoyment of the holiday the amount is usually in small coins although grandparents or other relatives may give larger sums as an official hanukkah gift  in israel hanukkah gelt is known as dmei hanukkah many hasidic rebbes distribute coins to those who visit them during hanukkah hasidic jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the rebbe and a segulah for success  rabbi abraham p bloch has written that the tradition of giving money chanukah gelt to children is of long standing the custom had its origin in the seventeenthcentury practice of polish jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers  in time as children demanded their due money was also given to children to keep for themselves  teenage boys soon came in for their share  according to magen avraham 18th cent it was the custom for poor yeshiva students to visit homes of jewish benefactors who dispensed chanukah money orach chaim 670  the rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil  twentiethcentury american chocolatiers picked up on the giftcoin concept by creating chocolate gelt the eating of dairy foods especially cheese on hanukkah is a minor custom that has its roots in the story of judith the deuterocanonical book of judith yehudit or yehudis in hebrew which is not part of the tanach records that holofernes an assyrian general had surrounded the village of bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer judea after intense fighting the water supply of the jews is cut off and the situation became desperate  judith a pious widow told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city  judith went to the assyrian camps and pretended to surrender she met holofernes who was smitten by her beauty she went back to his tent with him where she plied him with cheese and wine  when he fell into a drunken sleep judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp taking the severed head with her the beheading of holofernes by judith has historically been a popular theme in art  when holofernes soldiers found his corpse they were overcome with fear the jews on the other hand were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack the town was saved and the assyrians defeated  there is a longstanding jewish tradition that judith was the daughter of yochanan the kohen gadol and consequently a sister of mattathias the hasmonean and an aunt of judah the maccabee in the remas gloss on the shulchan aruch he writes there are authorities kol bo and the ran who say that one should eat cheese on hanukkah because the miracle was performed with milk that judith fed the enemy  the chofetz chaim there adds in his mishna berurah on the words that judith fed she was the daughter of yochanan the kohen gadol there was a decree that every espoused bride should submit to the dignitary first before the consummation of her marriage she fed cheese to the head of the oppressors in order to intoxicate him and cut his head and they all fled in hebrew the word hanukkah is written  or  nukkh it is most commonly transliterated to english as chanukah or hanukkah the former because the sound represented by ch  similar to the scottish pronunciation of loch does not exist in the english language  furthermore the letter chet  which is the first letter in the hebrew spelling is pronounced differently in modern hebrew voiceless uvular fricative than in classical hebrew voiceless pharyngeal fricative and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in english spelling  moreover the kaf consonant is geminate in classical but not modern hebrew adapting the classical hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal eth can lead to the spelling hanukkah while adapting the modern hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular eth leads to the spelling

maccabees and the seleucid syriangreeks the dates of hanukkah are determined by the hebrew calendar  hanukkah begins at the 25th day of kislev and concludes on the 2nd or 3rd day of tevet kislev can have 29 or 30 days the jewish day begins at sunset whereas the gregorian calendar begins the day at midnight  hanukkah begins on sunset of the date listed one of the earliest links with the white house occurred in 1951 when israeli prime minister david bengurion presented united states president harry truman with a hanukkah menorah but it was not until 1979 that a sitting president jimmy carter took part in a public hanukkah candlelighting ceremony on the national mall followed by the first hanukkah candlelighting ceremony in the white house itself led by president bill clinton in 2001 president george w bush held an official hanukkah reception in the white house in conjunction with the candlelighting ceremony and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by jewish leaders from around the country   in 2008 george bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony with a grandson of bengurion and a grandson of truman lighting the candles some jews in north america and israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to hanukkahs miracle of the oil emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence an example of this is the coalition on the environment and jewish lifes renewable energy campaign', 'candureactor the candu canada deuterium uranium reactor is a canadianinvented pressurized heavy water reactor the reactors are used in nuclear power plants to produce nuclear power from nuclear fuel  candu reactors were developed initially in the late 1950s and 1960s through a partnership between atomic energy of canada limited aecl the hydroelectric power commission of ontario renamed ontario hydro in 1974 and since 1999 known as ontario power generation canadian general electric now known as ge canada and other private industry participants the acronym candu a registered trademark of atomic energy of canada limited stands for canada deuterium uranium this is a reference to its deuteriumoxide heavy water moderator and its use of uranium fuel originally natural uranium  all current power reactors in canada are of the candu type  canada markets this power reactor abroad  in december 2009 the canadian federal government announced that they would be seeking private investors for a partial selloff of its candu division  the candu reactor is conceptually similar to most light water reactors although it differs in the details like other water moderated reactors fission reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a primary cooling loop a heat exchanger transfers the heat to a secondary cooling loop which powers a steam turbine with an electrical generator attached to it  any excess heat energy in the steam after flowing through the turbine is rejected into the environment in a variety of ways most typically into a large body of cool water such as a lake river or ocean  heat can also be disposed of using a cooling tower but they are avoided whenever possible because they reduce the plants efficiency  more recently built candu plants such as the darlington nuclear generating station near toronto ontario use a dischargediffuser system that limits the thermal effects in the environment to within natural variations the main difference between candus and other water moderated reactors is that candus use heavy water for neutron moderation the heavy water surrounds the fuel assemblies and primary coolant the heavy water is unpressurized and a cooling system is required to keep it from boiling at the time of its design canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the large heavy steel pressure vessel used in most light water reactors  instead the pressure is contained in much smaller tubes 10cm diameter that contain the fuel bundles  these smaller tubes are easier to fabricate than a large pressure vessel in order to allow the neutrons to flow freely between the bundles the tubes are made of a zirconium alloy zirconium  25 wt niobium which is highly transparent to neutrons the zircaloy tubes are surrounded by a much larger lowpressure tank known as a calandria which contains the majority of the moderator canada also lacked access to uranium enrichment facilities which were then extremely expensive to construct and operate the candu was therefore designed to use natural uranium as its fuel like the zeep reactor the first canadian reactor  traditional designs using light water as a moderator will absorb too many neutrons to allow a chain reaction to occur in natural uranium due to the low density of active nuclei  heavy water absorbs fewer neutrons than light water allowing a high neutron economy that can sustain a chain reaction even in unenriched fuel  also the low temperature of the moderator below the boiling point of water reduces changes in the neutrons speeds from collisions with the moving particles of the moderator neutron scattering the neutrons therefore are easier to keep near the optimum speed to cause fissioning they have good spectral purity  at the same time they are still somewhat scattered giving an efficient range of neutron energies the large thermal mass of the moderator provides a significant heat sink that acts as an additional safety feature if a fuel assembly were to overheat and deform within its fuel channel the resulting change of geometry permits high heat transfer to the cool moderator thus preventing the breach of the fuel channel and the possibility of a meltdown  furthermore because of the use of natural uranium as fuel this reactor cannot sustain a chain reaction if its original fuel channel geometry is altered in any significant manner in a traditional light water reactor lwr design the entire reactor core is a single large pressure vessel containing the light water which acts as moderator and coolant and the fuel arranged in a series of long bundles running the length of the core  to refuel such a reactor it must be shut down the pressure dropped the lid removed and a significant fraction of the core inventory such as onethird replaced in a batch procedure the candus calandriabased design allows individual fuel bundles to be removed without taking the reactor offline improving overall duty cycle or capacity factor a pair of remotely controlled fueling machines visit each end of an individual fuel string  one machine inserts new fuel while the other receives discharged fuel a lower 235u density also generally implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality due primarily to the relative depletion of 235u compared with the buildup of parasitic fission products  however through increased efficiency which among other benefits avoids the need for enriched uranium candu reactors use about 3040 less mined uranium than lightwater reactors per unit of electrical energy produced a candu fuel assembly consists of a number of zircaloy tubes containing ceramic pellets of fuel arranged into a cylinder that fits within the fuel channel in the reactor  in older designs the assembly had 28 or 37 halfmeterlong fuel tubes with 12 such assemblies lying end to end in a fuel channel the relatively new canflex bundle has 43 tubes with two pellet sizes it is about 10cm four inches in diameter 05m 20inches long and weighs about 20kg 44lb and replaces the 37tube bundle it has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by using two different pellet diameters a number of distributed lightwater compartments called liquid zone controllers help control the rate of fission the liquid zone controllers absorb excess neutrons and slow the fission reaction in their regions of the reactor core candu reactors employ two independent fastacting safety shutdown systems  shutoff rods penetrate the calandria vertically and lower into the core in the case of a safetysystem trip a secondary shutdown system involves injecting highpressure gadolinium nitrate solution directly into the lowpressure moderator the key to maintaining a nuclear reaction within a nuclear reactor is to use the neutrons being released during fission to stimulate fission in other nuclei  with careful control over the geometry and reaction rates this can lead to a selfsustaining chain reaction a state known as criticality natural uranium consists of a mixture of various isotopes primarily 238u and a much smaller amount about 072 by weight of 235u 238u can only be fissioned by neutrons that are fairly energetic about 1 mev or above  no amount of 238u can be made critical however since it will tend to parasitically absorb more neutrons than it releases by the fission process  in other words 238u is not fissile 235u on the other hand can support a selfsustained chain reaction but due to the low natural abundance of 235u natural uranium cannot achieve criticality by itself the trick to making a working reactor is to slow some of the neutrons to the point where their probability of causing nuclear fission in 235u increases to a level that permits a sustained chain reaction in the uranium as a whole  this requires the use of a neutron moderator which absorbs some of the neutrons kinetic energy slowing them down to an energy comparable to the thermal energy of the moderator nuclei themselves leading to the terminology of thermal neutrons and thermal reactors  during this slowingdown process it is beneficial to physically separate the neutrons from the uranium since 238u nuclei have an enormous parasitic affinity for neutrons in this intermediate energy range a reaction known as resonance absorption  this is a fundamental reason for designing reactors with discrete solid fuel separated by moderator rather than employing a more homogeneous mixture of the two materials water makes an excellent moderator the hydrogen atoms in the water molecules are very close in mass to a single neutron and thus have a potential for high energy transfer similar conceptually to the collision of two billiard balls  however in addition to being a good moderator water is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons  using water as a moderator will absorb enough neutrons that there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of 235u in natural uranium again precluding criticality  so light water reactors require fuel with an enhanced amount of 235u in the uranium that is enriched uranium which generally contains between 3 and 5 235u by weight the waste from this process is known as depleted uranium consisting primarily of 238u  in this enriched form there is enough 235u to react with the watermoderated neutrons to maintain criticality one complication of this approach is the requirement to build uranium enrichment facilities which are generally expensive to build and operate they also present a nuclear proliferation concern since the same systems used to enrich the 235u can also be used to produce much more pure weaponsgrade material 90 or more 235u suitable for making a nuclear bomb  operators could reduce these issues by purchasing readymade fuel assemblies from the reactor supplier and have the latter reprocess the spent fuel an alternative solution to the problem is to use a moderator that does not absorb neutrons as readily as water  in this case potentially all of the neutrons being released can be moderated and used in reactions with the 235u in which case there is enough 235u in natural uranium to sustain criticality  one such moderator is heavy water or deuteriumoxide it reacts dynamically with the neutrons in a similar fashion to light water albeit with less energy transfer on average given that heavy hydrogen or deuterium is about twice the mass of hydrogen the advantage is that it already has the extra neutron that light water would normally tend to absorb reducing the absorption rate the use of heavy water moderator is the key to the candu system enabling the use of natural uranium as fuel in the form of ceramic uo2 which means that it can be operated without expensive uranium enrichment facilities  additionally the mechanical arrangement of the candu which places most of the moderator at lower temperatures is particularly efficient because the resulting thermal neutrons are more thermal than in traditional designs where the moderator normally runs hot  this means that the candu is not only able to burn natural uranium and other fuels but tends to do so more effectively as well a further unique feature of heavywater moderation is the greater stability and better coherence of the chain reaction throughout the whole volume of the reactor  this is due to the relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus 22 mev leading to some energetic neutrons n2n and gamma rays photoneutron effect inside the reactor breaking deuterium nuclei apart and producing extra neutrons  since gamma rays and neutrons travel for many tens of centimeters through water an increased rate of chain reaction in any one part of the reactor will produce a wider less concentrated response from the rest of the reactor preventing local overheating and allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction  this effect produces a flatter flux distribution throughout the reactor evening out the power level  neutrons produced directly by fission have a higher average energy 2 mev than the delayed neutrons emitted in the decay of fission fragments 05 mev therefore the prompt neutrons are much more likely to multiply directly  both gammas produced directly by fission and those produced by the decay of fission fragments have enough energy for the photoneutron effect and the halflives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years this increases the proportion of delayed neutrons and slows the reactor response increasing safety compared with light water reactors a heavy water design is neutron rich  this makes the candu design suitable for burning a number of alternative nuclear fuels  to date the fuel to gain the most attention is mixed oxide fuel mox mox is a mixture of natural uranium and plutonium such as that extracted from former nuclear weapons  currently there is a worldwide surplus of plutonium due to the various agreements between the united states and the former soviet union to dismantle many of their warheads  however the security of these supplies is a cause for concern  one way to address this security issue is by converting the warhead into fuel and burning the plutonium in a candu reactor plutonium can also be extracted from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing  while this consists usually of a mixture of isotopes that is not attractive for use in weapons it can be used in a mox formulation reducing the net amount of nuclear waste that has to be disposed of plutonium isnt the only fissile material in spent nuclear fuel that candu reactors can utilize   because the candu reactor was designed to work with natural uranium candu fuel can be manufactured from the used depleted uranium found in light water reactor lwr spent fuel  typically this recovered uranium ru has a u235 enrichment of around 09 which makes it unusable to an lwr but a rich source of fuel to a candu natural uranium has a u235 abundance of roughly 07   it is estimated that a candu reactor can extract a further 3040 energy from lwr fuel recycling of lwr fuel does not necessarily need to involve a reprocessing step   fuel cycle tests have also included the dupic fuel cycle or direct use of spent pwr fuel in candu where used fuel from a pressurized water reactor is packaged into a candu fuel bundle with only physical reprocessing cut into pieces but no chemical reprocessing  again where lightwater reactors require the reactivity associated with enriched fuel the dupic fuel cycle is possible in a candu reactor due to the neutron economy which allows for the low reactivity of natural uranium and used enriched fuel several inertmatrix fuels have been proposed for the candu design which have the ability to burn plutonium and other actinides from spent nuclear fuel much more efficiently than in mox fuel   this is due to the inert nature of the fuel socalled because it lacks uranium and thus does not create plutonium at the same time as it is being consumed candu reactors can also breed fuel from natural thorium if uranium is unavailable the first candutype reactor was nuclear power demonstration npd in rolphton ontario it was intended as a proofofconcept design and was rated for only 22 mwe a very low power for a commercial power reactor it produced the first nucleargenerated electricity in canada and ran successfully from 1962 to 1987 the second candu was the douglas point reactor a more powerful version rated at roughly 200 mwe and located near kincardine ontario douglas point went into service in 1968 and ran until 1984  uniquely among candu stations douglas point incorporated an oilfilled window which offered a view of the east reactor face even when the reactor was operating the douglas point type was exported to india and was the basis for indias fleet of domestically designed and built canduderivatives  douglas point was originally planned to be a twounit station but the second unit was cancelled because of the success of the larger 515 mwe units at pickering in parallel to the development of the classic candu heavywater design experimental candu variants were developed   wr1 located at the aecls whiteshell laboratories in pinawa manitoba used vertical pressure tubes and organic oil as the primary coolant the oil used has a higher boiling point than water allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor   this reactor operated successfully for many years and promised a significantly higher thermal efficiency than watercooled versions  gentilly1 near troisrivires quebec was also an experimental version of candu using a boiling lightwater coolant and vertical pressure tubes but was not considered successful and was closed after 7 years of fitful operation the successes at npd and douglas point led to the decision to construct the first multiunit station in pickering ontario pickering a consisting of units 1 to 4 went into service in 1971   pickering b consisting of units 5 to 8 went into service in 1983 giving a fullstation capacity of 4120 mwe the station is placed very close to the city of toronto in order to reduce transmission costs pickering a was placed into voluntary layup in 1997 as a part of ontario hydros nuclear improvement plan note the electricity generating division of ontario hydro was renamed ontario power generation in 1999   units 1 and 4 have since been returned to service although not without considerable controversy regarding significant costoverruns especially on unit 4  the refurbishment of unit 1 was essentially ontime and onbudget in 2005 ontario power generation announced that refurbishment of units 2 and 3 at pickering a would not be pursued contrary to expectations the reason for this change in plan was economic the material condition of these units was much poorer than had existed for units 1 and 4 particularly the condition of the steam generators and thus the refurbishment costs would be much higher  this rendered a returntoservice of units 2 and 3 uneconomical the safe storage project to place these two units in a safe long term storage mode defuelled and drained was completed in 2010 the bruce nuclear generating station the second multiunit candu station was constructed in stages between 1970 and 1987 by the provincial crown corporation ontario hydro it consists of 8 units each rated at approximately 800 mwe each and is currently owned by ontario power generation opg and run by bruce power the bruce station is the largest nuclear facility in north america and second largest in the world after kashiwazakikariwa in japan comprising 8candu nuclear reactors having a total output of 6232mw net and 7276mw gross when all units are online  current output with 6 of the 8reactors on line is 4640mw  current plans are to restart the remaining two units by 2012 the central functionality behind the candu design is heavy water moderation and online refuelling which permits a range of fuel types to be used including natural uranium enriched uranium thorium and used fuel from light water reactors  significant fuel cost savings can be realized if the uranium does not have to be enriched but simply formed into ceramic natural uraniumdioxide fuel  this saves not only on the construction of an enrichment plant but also on the costs of processing the fuel however some of this potential savings is offset by the initial one time cost of the heavy water the heavy water required must be more than 9975 pure since heavy water is less efficient at transferring energy from neutrons the moderator volume relative to fuel volume is larger in candu reactors compared with lightwater designs making a candu reactor core generally larger than a light water reactor of the same power output  in turn this implies higher building costs for standard features like the containment building  this is offset to some degree by the calandriabased construction but even considering this the candu tends to have higher capital costs compared with other designs  in fact candu plant costs are dominated by construction costs the price of fuel representing perhaps 10 of the cost of the power it delivers  this is true in general of nuclear plants where the plant cost and cost of operations represent about 65 of overall lifetime cost   due to the lower fuelling costs compared to light water reactor designs the levelized lifetime cost on a perkwh basis tends to be comparable to these other designs when first being offered candus offered much better running time statistics the capacity factor than lightwater reactors of a similar generation  at the time lightwater lwr designs spent on average about half of their time in maintenance or refueling outages  however since the 1980s dramatic improvements in lwr outage management have narrowed the gap between lwr and candu with several lwr units achieving capacity factors in the 90 and higher range with an overall fleet performance of 895 in 2005  the latestgeneration candu 6 reactors have demonstrated an 8890 capacity factor but overall fleet performance is dominated by the older canadian units which generally report capacity factors on the order of 80 some candu plants suffered from cost overruns during construction primarily due to external factors  for instance a number of imposed construction delays led to roughly a doubling of the projected cost of the darlington nuclear generating station near toronto ontario technical problems and redesigns added about another billion to the resulting 144 billion price  in contrast the two candu 6 reactors more recently installed in china at the qinshan site were completed onschedule and onbudget an achievement attributed to tight control over scope and schedule in terms of safeguards against nuclear proliferation candu reactors meet a similar level of international certification as other reactor designs  however there is a common misconception that the plutonium for indias first nuclear detonation conducted in 1974 operation smiling buddha was produced in a candu design  in fact the plutonium was produced in the unsafeguarded cirus reactor whose design is based on the nrx a canadian research reactor  in addition to its two candu reactors india has some unsafeguarded pressurised heavy water reactors phwrs based on the candu design and two safeguarded lightwater reactors  supplied by the us plutonium has been extracted from the spent fuel from all of these sources in the prefre reprocessing facility another concern is tritium production  although heavy water is relatively immune to neutron capture a small amount of the deuterium turns into tritium via this process  tritium when mixed with deuterium undergoes nuclear fusion more easily than any other elemental mixture  small amounts of tritium can be used in both the trigger of an abomb and the fusion boost of a boosted fission weapon   tritium can also be used in the main fusion process of an hbomb but in this application it is typically generated in situ by neutron irradiation of lithium6 tritium is extracted from some candu plants in operation in canada primarily to improve safety in case of heavywater leakage the gas is stockpiled and used in a variety of commercial products notably powerless lighting systems and medical devices  in 1985 what was then ontario hydro sparked controversy in ontario due to its plans to sell tritium to the us the plan by law involved sales to nonmilitary applications only but some speculated that even this minor penetration of the market would aid the us nuclear weapon program  demands for this supply in the future appear to outstrip production in particular the needs of future generations of experimental fusion reactors like iter will use up a significant amount of any potential stockpile  currently between 15 and 21kg of tritium are recovered yearly at the darlington separation facility of which a minor fraction is sold the 1998 operation shakti test series in india included one bomb of about 45 kt yield that india has publicly claimed was a hydrogen bomb an offhand comment in the barc publication heavy water  properties production and analysis appears to suggest that the tritium was extracted from the heavy water in the candu and phwr reactors in commercial operation  janes intelligence review quotes the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission as admitting to the tritium extraction plant but refusing to comment on its use it is known however that india has developed the technology to create tritium from the neutronirradiation of lithium6 in reactors a process that is several orders of magnitude more efficient than the extraction of tritium from irradiated heavy water today there are 29 candu reactors in use around the world and a further 13 canduderivatives in use in india these reactors were developed from the candu design after india detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974 and canada stopped nuclear dealings with india the countries the reactors are located in are interest continues to be expressed in new candu construction around the world and candu technology is typically involved in open bidding processes alongside lwr technology candu reactors have been proposed as the main vehicle for planned supply replacement and growth in ontario canada a province that currently generates over 50 of its electricity from candu reactors with canadian government help with financing  interest has also been expressed in western canada where candu reactors are being considered as heat and electricity sources for the energyintensive oil sands extraction process which currently uses natural gas  energy alberta corporation headquartered in calgary announced august 27 2007 that they had filed application for a licence to build a new nuclear plant at lac cardinal 30km west of the town of peace river alberta the application would see an initial twin aecl acr1000 plant go online in 2017 producing 22 gigawatt electric romania is in discussions for the completion of its multiunit nuclear plant at cernavoda now consisting of two operating candu reactors   three more partially completed candu reactors exist on the same site part of a project discontinued at the close of the nicolae ceauescu regime turkey has repeatedly shown interest in the candu reactor but so far has chosen not to pursue nuclear energy  in april 2006 plans to build a nuclear reactor on the ince peninsula caused a large antinuclear demonstration in the turkish city of sinope the enhanced candu 6 is an evolutionary upgrade of the standard candu 6 design rated to deliver a gross output of 740 mwe per unit the units are designed with a planned operating life of over fifty years which will be achieved with a midlife program to replace some of the key components such as the fuel channels the plants have a projected average annual capacity factor of more than ninety per cent enhancements to the candu 6 design to achieve higher plant output include the installation of an ultrasonic flow meter ufm to improve the accuracy of feedwater flow measurements improvements in turbine design itself and change in condenser vacuum system design for operation at lower condenser pressures aecl continues to develop other features to further improve the plants performance while maintaining the basic features of the candu 6 design which over time has proven to be extremely reliable with an excellent production record since the early 1980s the additional enhancements include the acr1000 represents the continuing evolution of candu design to match changing market conditions  acr1000 is the nextgeneration officially generation iii candu technology from atomic energy of canada ltd aecl which maintains proven elements of existing candu design while making some significant modifications at the same time the basic and defining design features of candu are all maintained it is expected that the capital cost of constructing these plants will be reduced by up to 40 compared to current candu 6 plants in 2007 aecl submitted the acr1000 design to the british generic design assessment process to evaluate reactors for a new british nuclear power station program  however in 2008 aecl withdrew the design from the evaluation stating that aecl is focusing its marketing and licensing resources for the advanced candu reactor on the immediate needs of the canadian domestic marketplace tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen h3 with a halflife of 123 years it is found in small amounts in nature about 4kg globally created by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere  tritium is considered to be a weak radionuclide because of the low energy of its radioactive emissions beta particle energy 0 19 kev the beta particles do not travel very far in air and do not penetrate skin therefore the main biological hazard of tritium is due to its intake into the body inhalation ingestion or absorption tritium is generated in all nuclear power designs however candu reactors generate more tritium in their coolant and moderator than lightwater designs due to neutron capture in heavy hydrogen some of this tritium escapes into containment and is generally recovered however a small percentage about 1 escapes containment and constitutes a routine radioactive emission from candu plants also higher than from an lwr of comparable size   operation of a candu plant therefore includes monitoring of this effluent in the surrounding biota and publishing the results in order to ensure that emissions are maintained below regulatory limits in some candu reactors the tritium concentration in the moderator is periodically reduced by an extraction process in order to further reduce this risk   typical tritium emissions from candu plants in canada are less than 1 of the national regulatory limit which is based upon the guidelines of the international commission on radiological protection icrp for example the maximum permitted drinking water concentration for tritium in canada 7000 bql corresponds to 110 of the icrps public dose limit   tritium emissions from other candu plants are similarly low in general there is significant public controversy associated with radioactive emissions from nuclear power plants and for candu plants one of the main concerns is tritium    in 2007 greenpeace published a httpwwwgreenpeaceorgrawcontentcanadaendocumentsandlinkspublicationstritiumhazardreportpollupdf critique of tritium emissions from canadian nuclear power plants by dr ian fairlie this report was httpwwwnuclearfaqcareviewofgreenpeacereportfinalpdf disputed by dr richard osborne', 'contras the contras is a label given to the various rebel groups opposing nicaraguas fsln frente sandinista de liberacin nacional sandinista junta of national reconstruction government following the july 1979 overthrow of anastasio somoza debayles dictatorship  although the contra movement included a number of separate groups with different aims and little ideological unity the nicaraguan democratic force fdn emerged as by far the largest  in 1987 virtually all contra organizations were united at least nominally into the nicaraguan resistance from an early stage the rebels received both overt and covert financial and military support from the united states government through the central intelligence agency cia initially supplemented by the argentine dictatorship of the time  at other times the us congress wished to distance itself from the contras and withdrew all overt support the term contra comes from the spanish contra which means against but in this case is short for la contrarrevolucion in english the counterrevolution  many references use the uncapitalized form contra sometimes italicizing it some rebels disliked being called contras feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms or implied a desire to restore the old order  rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as comandos commandos peasant sympathizers also called the rebels los primos the cousins  from the mid1980s as the reagan administration and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the democratic resistance members started describing themselves as la resistencia during the war against the sandinista government they carried out many violations of human rights  their supporters in miami and the white house usually countered that the sandinista government carried out more such violations but in retrospect it is clear that they downplayed the severity of the abuses of the contras  in 1989 human rights watch released a report on the situation which stated the contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians selectively murdering noncombatants and mistreating prisoners  several other human rights organizations including early opposition to the sandinistas comprised many disparate strands the cia and argentine intelligence aided by former ciaside operative ernesto bernadet seeking to unify the antisandinista cause before initiating largescale aid persuaded the 15th of september legion and the udn to merge in august 1981 as the nicaraguan democratic force fuerza democrtica nicaragense fdn based in honduras nicaraguas northern neighbor under the command of former national guard colonel enrique bermdez the new fdn drew in the other rebel forces in the north the core leadership was initially dominated by former guardia ncos but milpas veterans rose through the ranks during the war and bermdez was ultimately replaced by milpista oscar sobalvarro a joint political directorate was created in december 1982 soon led by businessman and antisandinista politician adolfo calero the creation of the democratic revolutionary alliance arde and its armed wing the sandino revolutionary front frs in september 1982 saw the opening of a second front in the war the group was founded in neighboring costa rica by edn pastora comandante cero a former sandinista and participant in the august 1978 seizure of somozas palace  arde consisted largely of sandinista dissidents and veterans of the antisomoza campaign who opposed the increased influence of soviet union warsaw pact and cuban officials in the managua government  proclaiming his ideological distance from the fdn pastora nevertheless opened a southern front in the war a third force misurasata appeared among the miskito sumo and rama amerindian peoples of nicaraguas atlantic coast who in december 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the governments efforts to nationalize indian land they had a number of grievances against the sandinistas including the misurasata movement led by brooklyn rivera split in 1983 with the breakaway misura group of stedman fagoth muller allying itself more closely with the fdn a subsequent autonomy statute in september 1987 largely defused miskito resistance us officials were active in attempting to unite the contra groups  in june 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the united nicaraguan opposition uno under the leadership of calero arturo cruz and alfonso robelo all originally supporters of the antisomoza revolution  after its dissolution early in 1987 the nicaraguan resistance rn was organized along similar lines in may  splits within the rebel movement emerged with misurasatas april 1985 accommodation with the sandinista government the formation of the southern opposition bloc bos under alfredo csar by those excluded from uno and pastoras withdrawal from the struggle in may 1986 mediation by other central american governments under costa rican leadership led to the sapoa accord ceasefire of march 23 1988 which along with additional agreements in february and august 1989 provided for the contras disarmament and reintegration into nicaraguan society and politics the agreements also called for another internationallymonitored election which was subsequently held on february 25 1990  violeta chamorro a former sandinista ally who turned into a vocal opponent and widow of murdered antisomoza journalist pedro joaqun chamorro cardenal defeated sandinista leader daniel ortega by a huge margin and became president with the backing of the centerright uno some contra elements and disgruntled sandinistas would return briefly to armed opposition in the 1990s sometimes styled as recontras or revueltos but these groups were subsequently persuaded to disarm the catholic church in nicaragua to which 85 of nicaraguans claimed to belong to quote from cardinal miguel obando y bravos may 12 1986 washington post letter to the editor sandinistas gagged and bound us which greatly influenced the gifting of the us congress of 100 million in military aid to the contras pope john paul ii visited nicaragua in 1983 and publicly scolded the ortega government for its liberation theology  culture minister ernesto cardenal knelt in front of the pope while being scolded by the fingerwagging pontiff on may 25 1985 pope john paul ii promoted archbishop obando y bravo to the rank of cardinal the sandinista government its supporters and outside groups such as americas watch frequently accused the contras of indiscriminate attacks on civilians the contras and their backers especially those in the reagan administration dismissed these accusations as a propaganda campaign and accused the sandinistas of the same crimes against humanity the catholic institute for international relations ciir now known as progressio a human rights organization which identifies itself with liberation theology summarized contra operating procedures in their 1987 human rights report  the record of the contras in the field as opposed to their official professions of democratic faith is one of consistent and bloody abuse of human rights of murder torture mutilation rape arson destruction and kidnapping an influential report on contra atrocities was issued by lawyer reed brody shortly before the 1985 us congressional vote on contra aid the report was soon published as a book it charged that the contras attacked purely civilian targets and that their tactics included murder rape beatings kidnapping and disruption of harvests  brodys report had been requested by the sandinista governments washington law firm reichler  applebaum and the sandinista government had provided facilities in nicaragua for him  in a letter to the new york times brody asserted that this in no way affected his report and added that the newspaper had confirmed the veracity of four randomly chosen incidents a sandinista militiaman interviewed by the guardian stated that contra rebels committed these atrocities against sandinista prisoners after a battle at a sandinista rural outpost americas watch  which subsequently became part of human rights watch  stated that the contras systematically engage in violent abuses so prevalent that these may be said to be their principal means of waging war it accused the contras of us news media published several articles accusing americas watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting it alleged that americas watch gave too much credence to alleged contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit nicaraguan human rights groups such as the permanent commission on human rights which blamed the major human rights abuses on the sandinistas in 1985 the wall street journal reported this was part of a strategy of the reagan administration that largely involved stonewalling the press on matters of human rights violations in addition to skepticism of contra abuses the white house insisted that the notorious el mozote massacre carried out by government death squads trained at the school of the americas didnt happen  however with regard to nicaragua their tactic was refuted by many activists on the ground including human rights watch who said the following of the white houses attempts at denial a key role in the development of the contra alliance was played by the united states following ronald reagans assumption of the presidency in january 1981  reagan accused the sandinistas of importing cubanstyle socialism and aiding leftist guerrillas in el salvador on january 4 1982 reagan signed the top secret national security decision directive 17 nsdd17 giving the cia the authority to recruit and support the contras with 19 million in military aid the effort to support the contras was one component of the reagan doctrine which called for providing military support to movements opposing sovietsupported communist governments the cia distributed to the civilians the freedom fighters manual meant to teach them simple sabotage methods not going to work damaging light bulbs putting nails on roads etc and more dangerous ones how to make a molotov cocktail in 1984 sandinistarun nicaraguan government filed a suit in the international court of justice icj against the united states nicaragua vs united states which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the united states calling on it to cease and to refrain from the unlawful use of force against nicaragua through such actions as the placement of underwater mines by cia operatives and training funding and support for the guerrilla forces the court concluded that the united states was in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another state not to intervene in its affairs not to violate its sovereignty not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce and in breach of its obligations under article xix of the treaty of friendship commerce and navigation between the parties signed at managua on 21 january 1956  regarding human rights violations by the contras however the court stated that the united states could be held accountable only for acts the contras committed in connection with the united states and therefore the court does not have to determine whether the violations of humanitarian law attributed to the contras were in fact committed by them the court found that the united states has encouraged the commission by them the contras of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed are imputable to the united states of america as acts of the united states of america the united states was ordered to pay reparations the united states which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings maintained that the icjs power did not supersede the constitution of the united states and argued that the court did not seriously consider the nicaraguan role in el salvador whose intervention the court would not accept the latter argument was affirmed by the primary dissenting justicesnotably us judge schwebel who claimed that nicaragua does not come before the court with clean hands httpwwwicjcijorgicjwwwicasesinusinusisummariesinusisummary19860627htm nicaragua then took its case to the un security council where a resolution supporting the ruling of the icj was vetoed by the united states nicaragua then went to the general assembly which passed a resolution supporting the ruling of the icj 943 direct military aid by the united states was interrupted by the boland amendment passed by the united states congress in december 1982  the boland amendment was extended in october 1984 to forbid action by not only the defense department and the central intelligence agency but all us government agencies administration officials sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of thirdparties  these efforts culminated in the irancontra affair of 19861987 which concerned contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to iran on february 3 1988 the united states house of representatives rejected president reagans request for 3625 million to aid the contras according to the national security archive oliver north an important official in the irancontra affair had been in contact with manuel noriega the military leader of panama later convicted on drug charges whom he personally met the issue of drug money and its importance in funding the nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications the contras were funded by drug trafficking of which the usa was aware the reagan administrations support for the contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s  in august 1996 san jose mercury news reporter gary webb published a series titled dark alliance alleging that the contras contributed to the rise of crack cocaine in california httpwwwnarconewscomdarkalliancedrugsstarthtm httpwwwgwuedunsarchivnsaebbnsaebb2nsaebb2htm webbs controversial and highly damaging revelations were disputed at the time but later revelations confirmed much of his reportage while faced with the largest standing army in the history of central america the downing of soviet supplied mi24 helicopter gunships by us supplied redeye missiles after a cutoff in us military support and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict the contras agreed to negotiations with the fsln this had the short term effect of allowing opposition candidate violeta chamorro to win a landslide 55 to 41 victory over daniel ortega with chamorro winning nearly 68 of the rural vote  this in spite of the fact that the estimated 500000 refugees created by the war living outside nicaragua were not allowed to cast absentee ballots as reported in the washington post in areas where the contras were most active the landslide victory at the polls was most pronounced  another myth was that the antisandinista rebels or contras portrayed for years as widely reviled in nicaragua would drag uno to defeat because the coalition was too closely identified with them and included former contra leaders  as it happened the two regions where the contras have been most active showed among the most lopsided results in favor of uno in the central provinces of chontales and boaco uno won with 679 percent of the vote compared to 277 percent for the sandinistas in the northern provinces of matagalpa and jinotega uno got 577 percent of the vote to the sandinistas 37 percent', 'crystaleastman crystal eastman was born in marlborough massachusetts on june 25 1881 the daughter of a protestant minister she graduated from vassar

unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings the c130 was originally designed as a troop medical evacuation and cargo transport aircraft the versatile airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles including as a gunship ac130 for airborne assault search and rescue scientific research support weather reconnaissance aerial refueling maritime patrol and aerial firefighting it is the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide  over 40 models and variants of the hercules serve with more than 60 nations during its years of service the hercules family has participated in countless military civilian and humanitarian aid operations the family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history  in 2007 the c130 became the fifth aircraftafter the english electric canberra b52 stratofortress tupolev tu95 and kc135 stratotankerto mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer in this case the united states air force the c130 is also the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for 50 years with its original customer as the updated c130j super hercules the korean war which began in june 1950 showed that pistonpowered world war iiera transportsc119 flying boxcars c47 skytrains and c46 commandoswere inadequate for modern warfare  thus on 2 february 1951 the united states air force issued a general operating requirement gor for a new transport to boeing douglas fairchild lockheed martin chase aircraft north american northrop and airlifts inc the new transport would have a capacity for 92 passengers 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that is approximately convert41 long convert9 high and convert10 wide  unlike transports derived from passenger airliners it was designed from the groundup as a combat transport with loading from a ramp at the rear of the fuselage  this innovation for military cargo aircraft was first pioneered on the ww ii german junkers ju 252 and ju 253 hercules transport prototypes in wwii the boeing c97 also had a retracting ramp through clamshell doors but could not be used for airdrops of cargo the hercules also resembled a larger fourengine brother to the c123 provider with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout  that plane evolved from the chase xcg20 avitruc which was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947  the rear ramp not only makes it possible to drive vehicles onto the plane also possible with forward ramp on a c124 but to airdrop or use lowaltitude extraction for sheridan tanks or even dropping improvised daisy cutter bombs a key feature was the introduction of the t56 turboprop which was first developed specifically for the c130  at the time the turboprop was a new application of jet engines that used exhaust gases to turn a shafted propeller which offered greater range at propellerdriven speeds compared to pure jets which were faster but thirstier  as was the case on helicopters of that era such as the uh1 huey turboshafts produced much more power for their weight than piston engines  lockheed would subsequently use the same engines and technology in the lockheed l188 electra that plane was a disappointment as an airliner but quite successfully adapted as the p3 orion patrol plane where speed and endurance of turboprops excelled the new lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of convert1100 takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips and the ability to fly with one engine shut down  fairchild north american martin and northrop declined to participate the remaining five companies tendered a total of 10 designs  lockheed two boeing one chase three douglas three and airlifts inc one the contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two lockheed preliminary project designation l206 proposals and a fourturboprop douglas design the lockheed design team was led by willis hawkins starting with a 130 page proposal for the lockheed l206  hall hibbard lockheed vice president and chief engineer saw the proposal and directed it to kelly johnson who did not care for the lowspeed unarmed aircraft and remarked if you sign that letter you will destroy the lockheed company the first flight of the yc130 prototype was made on 23 august 1954 from the lockheed plant in burbank california the aircraft serial number 533397 was the second prototype but the first of the two to fly the yc130 was piloted by stanley beltz and roy wimmer on its 61minute flight to edwards air force base jack real and dick stanton served as flight engineers  kelly johnson flew chase in a p2v neptune after the two prototypes were completed production began in marietta georgia where more than 2300 c130s have been built the initial production model the c130a was powered by allison t56a9 turboprops with threeblade propellers  deliveries began in december 1956 continuing until the introduction of the c130b model in 1959  some a models were redesignated c130d after being equipped with skis the newer c130b had ailerons with increased boost3000psi 21mpa versus 2050psi 14mpaas well as uprated engines and fourbladed propellers that were standard until the jmodels introduction the first production c130s were designated as amodels with deliveries in 1956 to the 463d troop carrier wing at ardmore afb oklahoma and the 314th troop carrier wing at sewart afb tennessee six additional squadrons were assigned to the 322d air division in europe and the 315th air division in the far east additional airplanes were modified for electronics intelligence work and assigned to rheinmain air base germany while modified rc130as were assigned to the military air transport service mats photomapping division  airplanes equipped with giant skis were designated as c130ds but were essentially amodels except for the conversion  australia became the first non american force to operate the c130a hercules with 12 examples being delivered during late 1958early 1959  these aircraft were fitted with threeblade aeroproducts propeller of 15 diameter  as the c130a became operational with tactical air command tac the c130s lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added in the form of external pylonmounted tanks at the end of the wings the amodel continued in service through the vietnam war where the airplanes assigned to the four squadrons at naha ab okinawa and one at tachikawa air base japan performed yeomans service including operating highly classified special operations missions such as the blind bat facflare mission and fact sheet leaflet mission over laos and north vietnam the amodel was also provided to the south vietnamese air force as part of the vietnamization program at the end of the war and equipped three squadrons based at tan son nhut afb the last operator in the world is the honduran air force which is still flying one of five a model hercs fah 558 cn 3042 as of october 2009 the c130b model was developed to complement the a models that had previously been delivered and incorporated new features particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an

lzs for helicopters  these would later be used by south vietnam forces in a lastditch air support effort to turn back communist troops  as the vietnam war wound down the 463rd bmodels and amodels of the 374th tactical airlift wing were transferred back to the united states where most were assigned to air force reserve and air national guard units  another prominent role for the b model was with the united states marine corps where hercules initially designated as gv1s replaced c119s  after air force c130ds proved the types usefulness in antarctica the us navy purchased a number of bmodels equipped with skis that were designated as lc130s an electronic reconnaissance variant of the c130b was designated c130bii  a total of 13 aircraft were converted and operated under the sun valley program name they were operated primarily from yokota air base japan all reverted to standard c130b cargo aircraft after their replacement in the reconnaissance role by other aircraft the c130bii was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks which were disguised signals intelligence sigint receiver antennas  these pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other c130bs  most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other c130s  radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission the extended range c130e model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim longrange transport for the military air transport service essentially a bmodel the new designation was the result of the installation of 1360us gal 5150l sargent fletcher external fuel tanks under each wings midsection and more powerful allison t56a7a turboprops the hydraulic boost pressure to the ailerons was reduced back to 2050 psi as a consequence of the external tanks weight in the middle of the wingspan the e model also featured structural improvements avionics upgrades and a higher gross weight  australia took delivery of 12 c130e hercules during 196667 to supplement the 12 c130a models already in service with the raaf the kc130 tankers originally c130fs procured for the us marine corps usmc in 1958 under the designation gv1 are equipped with a removable 3600us gal 13626l stainless steel fuel tank carried inside the cargo compartment the two wingmounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300us gal per minute 19l per second to two aircraft simultaneously allowing for rapid cycle times of multiplereceiver aircraft formations a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes the us navys c130g has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation the c130h model has updated allison t56a15 turboprops a redesigned outer wing updated avionics and other minor improvements  later h models had a new fatiguelifeimproved center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier hmodels the h model remains in widespread use with the us air force usaf and many foreign air forces  initial deliveries began in 1964 to the rnzaf remaining in production until 1996  an improved c130h was introduced in 1974 with australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 c130a models which had first entered raaf service in 1958 the united states coast guard employs the hc130h for long range search and rescue drug interdiction illegal migrant patrols homeland security and logistics c130h models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as c130h3 by the usaf the 3 denoting the third variation in design for the h series  improvements included ring laser gyros for the inus gps receivers a partial glass cockpit adi and hsi instruments a more capable apn241 color radar night vision device compatible instrument lighting and an integrated radar and missile warning system the electrical system upgrade included generator control units gcu and bus switching units bsuto provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components the equivalent model for export to the uk is the c130k known by the royal air force raf as the hercules c1  the c130h30 hercules c3 in raf service is a stretched version of the original hercules achieved by inserting a 100in 254m plug aft of the cockpit and an 80in 203m plug at the rear of the fuselage a single c130k was purchased by the met office for use by its meteorological research flight where it was classified as the hercules w2  this aircraft was heavily modified with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage  this aircraft named snoopy was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by marshall of cambridge aerospace as flighttest bed for the a400m turbine engine the tp400 the c130k is used by the raf falcons for parachute drops  three c130k hercules c mk1p were upgraded and sold to the austrian air force in 2002 the mc130e combat talon was developed for the usaf during the vietnam war to support special operations missions throughout southeast asia and spawned a family of special missions aircraft 37 of the earliest models currently operating with the united states special operations command are scheduled to be replaced by newproduction mc130j versions the ec130 and ec130h compass call are versions also used by special operations the hc130pn is long range search and rescue variant used by the usaf to include the air force reserve command and the air national guard that was developed from the earlier hc130p  equipped for deep deployment of pararescuemen pjs survival equipment and aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters hc130s are usually the onscene command aircraft for combat sar missions  early versions were equipped with the fulton surfacetoair recovery system designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon the john wayne movie the green berets features its use the fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile the movie the perfect storm depicts a real life sar mission involving aerial refueling of a new york air national guard hh60g by a new york air national guard hc130p the c130r and c130t are us navy and usmc models both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks the usn c130t is similar but has additional avionics improvements  in both models aircraft are equipped with allison t56a16 engines the usmc versions are designated kc130r or kc130t when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully night vision system compatible the rc130 is a reconnaissance version a single example is used by the islamic republic of iran air force the aircraft having originally been sold to the former imperial iranian air force the lockheed l100 l382 is a civilian variant equivalent to a c130e model without military equipment the l100 also has 2 stretched versions in the 1970s lockheed proposed a c130 variant with turbofan engines rather than turboprops but the us air force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft  in the 1980s the c130 was intended to be replaced by the advanced medium stol transport project the project was canceled and the c130 has remained in production in the 1990s the improved c130j super hercules was developed by lockheed later lockheed martin this model is the newest version and the only model in production  externally similar to the classic hercules in general appearance the j model has new turboprop engines sixbladed propellers digital avionics and other new systems in 2000 boeing was awarded a 14 billion contract to develop an avionics modernization programme kit for the c130  the program was beset with delays and cost overruns until project restructuring in 2007  on 2 september 2009 bloomberg news reported that the planned avionics modernization program amp upgrade to the older c130s would be dropped to provide more funds for the f35 cv22 and airborne tanker replacement programs  however in june 2010 the pentagon approved funding for the initial production of the amp upgrade kits  under the terms of this agreement the usaf has cleared boeing to begin lowrate initial production lrip for the c130 amp a total of 198 aircraft are expected to feature the amp upgrade the current cost per aircraft is 14 million although boeing expects that this price will drop to us7 million for the 69th aircraft the hercules holds the record for the largest and heaviest aircraft to land on an aircraft carrier  in october and november 1963 a usmc kc130f buno 149798 bailed to the us naval air test center made 29 touchandgo landings 21 unarrested fullstop landings and 21 unassisted takeoffs on the uss forrestal at a number of different weights the pilot lt later radm james h flatley iii usn was awarded the distinguished flying cross for his role in this test series the tests were highly successful but the idea was considered too risky for routine carrier onboard delivery cod operations  instead the c2 greyhound was developed as a dedicated cod aircraft the hercules used in the test most recently in service with marine aerial refueler squadron 352 vmgr352 until 2005 is now part of the collection of the national museum of naval aviation at nas pensacola florida while the c130 is involved in cargo and resupply operations daily it has been a part of some notable offensive operations in 1964 c130 crews from the 6315th operations group at naha ab okinawa commenced facflare missions over the ho chi minh trail in laos supporting usaf strike aircraft  in april 1965 the mission was expanded to north vietnam where c130 crews led formations of b57 bombers on night reconnaissancestrike missions against communist supply routes leading to south vietnam in early 1966 project blind batlamplighter was established at ubon rtafb thailand after the move to ubon the mission became a fourengine forward air controller fac mission with the c130 crew searching for targets then calling in strike aircraft  another littleknown c130 mission flown by nahabased crews was commando scarf which involved the delivery of chemicals onto sections of the ho chi minh trail in laos that were designed to produce mud and landslides in hopes of making the truck routes impassable in november 1964 on the other side of the globe c130es from the 464th troop carrier wing but loaned to 322d air division in france flew one of the most dramatic missions in history in the former belgian congo after a congolese rebel group named simba took whites in the city of stanleyville hostage the us and belgian developed a joint rescue mission that used the c130s to airlift and then drop and airland a force of belgian paratroopers to rescue the hostages  two missions were flown one over stanleyville designated as red dragondragon rouge and another over paulis called black dragondragon noir during thanksgiving weeks the headlinemaking mission resulted in the first award of the prestigious mackay trophy to c130 crews in october 1968 a c130b from the 463rd tactical airlift wing dropped a pair of m121 10000 pound bombs that had been developed for the massive b36 bomber but had never been used the us army and us air force resurrected the huge weapons as a means of clearing landing zones for helicopters and in early 1969 the 463rd commenced commando vault missions  although the stated purpose of commando vault was to clear lzs they were also used on enemy base camps and other targets the mc130 combat talon variant carries and deploys the among the largest conventional bombs in the world the blu82 daisy cutter and gbu43b massive ordnance air blast bomb also known as the moab daisy cutters were used during the vietnam war to clear landing zones and to eliminate mine fields the weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional bombers the gbu43b moab is a successor to the blu82 and can perform the same function as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment the ac130 also holds the record for the longest sustained flight by a c130  from 22 october to 24 october 1997 two ac130u gunships flew 360 hours nonstop from hurlburt field florida to taegu daegu south korea while being refueled 7 times by kc135 tanker aircraft  this record flight shattered the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours while the 2 gunships took on convert410000 of fuel the gunship has been used in every major us combat operation since vietnam except for operation eldorado canyon the 1986 attack on libya in the indopakistani war of 1965 the pakistan air force modifiedimprovised several aircraft for use as heavy bombers and attacks were made on indian bridges and troop concentrations with some successes  no aircraft were lost in the operations though one was slightly damaged it was also used in the 1976 entebbe raid in which israeli commando forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner hijacked by palestinian and german terrorists at entebbe airport uganda the rescue force200 soldiers jeeps and a black mercedesbenz intended to resemble ugandan dictator idi amins vehicle of statewas flown convert2200 from israel to entebbe by four israeli air force iaf hercules aircraft without midair refueling on the way back the planes refueled in nairobi kenya during the falklands war guerra de las malvinas of 1982 argentine air force c130s undertook highly dangerous daily resupply night flights as blockade runners to the argentine garrison on the falkland islands they also performed daylight maritime survey flights  one was lost during the war  argentina also operated two kc130s tankers during the war and these refueled both the skyhawk and navy super etendards which sank 6 british ships the british also used their c130s to support their logistical operations during the gulf war of 1991 operation desert storm the c130 hercules was used operationally by the us air force us navy and us marine corps along with the air forces of australia new zealand saudi arabia south korea and the uk during the invasion of afghanistan in 2001 and the ongoing support of the international security assistance force operation enduring freedom the c130 hercules has used operationally by australia belgium canada denmark

operationally by australia the uk and the united states after the initial invasion c130 operators as part of the multinational force in iraq used their c130s to support their forces in iraq one raf c130 was shot down on 30 january 2005 when an iraqi insurgent brought it down firing with a zu23 antiaircraft artillery gun while the plane was flying at 164ft 50m after it had dropped sas special forces paratroopers a prominent c130t aircraft is fat albert the support aircraft for the us navy blue angels flight demonstration team  although fat albert supports a navy squadron it is operated by the us marine corps usmc and its crew consists solely of usmc personnel  at some air shows featuring the team fat albert takes part performing flyovers and sometimes demonstrating its jetassisted takeoff jato capabilities but the jato demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets both the pakistan army and the pakistan air force extensively use c130 aircraft to support their relief and rescue operations as well as the military operations in the country the us forest service developed the modular airborne firefighting system for the c130 in the 1970s which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an airtanker for fighting wildfires  in the late 1980s 22 retired usaf c130as were removed from storage at davismonthan air force base and transferred to the us forest service who then sold them to six private companies to be converted into air tankers see us forest service airtanker scandal  after one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight as a result of fatigue stress cracking the entire fleet of c130a air tankers was permanently grounded in 2004 see 2002 airtanker crashes  c130s have been used to spread chemical dispersants onto the massive oil slick in the gulf coast in 2010 significant military variants of the c130 include the c130 is a reliable aircraft the royal air force recorded an accident rate of about one aircraft loss per 250000 flying hours over the last forty years placing it behind vickers vc10s and lockheed tristars with no flying losses  however more than 15 percent of the 2350plus production has been lost including 70 by the united states air force and the united states marine corps while serving in the war in southeast asia by the nature of the hercules worldwide service the pattern of losses provides an interesting barometer of the global hot spots over the past fifty years', 'chianti the first definition of a winearea called chianti was made in 1716  it described the area near the villages of gaiole castellina and radda the socalled lega del chianti and later provincia del chianti chianti province  in 1932 the chianti area was completely redrawn and divided in seven subareas  classico colli aretini colli fiorentini colline pisane colli senesi montalbano and rfina most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new chianti classico area added in chianti to their namesuch as greve in chianti which amended its name in 1972  wines labeled chianti classico come from the biggest subarea of chianti that subarea that includes the old chianti area the other variants with the exception of rufina from the northeast side of florence and montalbano in the south of pistoia originate in the respective named provinces  siena for the colli senesi florence for the colli fiorentini arezzo for the colli aretini and pisa for the colline pisane in 1996 part of the colli fiorentini subarea was renamed montespertoli during the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in chianti in 1995 it became legal to produce a chianti with 100 sangiovese for a wine to retain the name of chianti it must be produced with at least 80 sangiovese grapes a chianti may have a picture of a black rooster known in italian as a gallo nero on the neck of the bottle which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the gallo nero consortium an association of producers of the classico subarea sharing marketing costs  since 2005 the black rooster has been the emblem of the chianti classico producers association  aged chianti 38 months instead of 47 may be labelled as riserva chianti that meets more stringent requirements lower yield higher alcohol content and dry extract may be labelled as chianti superiore although chianti from the classico subarea is not allowed in any event to be labelled as superiore the earliest documentation of a chianti wine dates back to the thirteenth century when viticulture was known to flourish in the chianti mountains around florence the merchants in the nearby townships of castellina gaiole and radda formed the lega del chianti league of chianti to produce and promote the local wine  in 1398 records note that the earliest incarnation of chianti was as a white wine by the eighteenth century chianti was widely recognized as a red wine but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make chianti at this point is unknown  ampelographers find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of italian writer cosimo villifranchi who noted that canaiolo was widely planted variety in the area along with sangiovese mammolo and marzemino prior to ricasoli canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the chianti blend with sangiovese and malvasia playing supporting roles  in the midnineteenth century ricasoli developed a recipe for chianti that was based primarily on sangiovese his recipe called for 70 sangiovese 15 canaiolo 10 malvasia later amended to include trebbiano and 5 other local red varieties in 1967 the denominazione di origine controllata doc regulation set by the italian government firmly established the ricasoli formula of a sangiovesebased blend with 1030 malvasia and trebbiano the late nineteenth century saw a period of economic and political upheaval  first came oidium and then the phylloxera epidemic would take it toll on the vineyards of chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of europe the chaos and poverty following the risorgimento heralded the beginning of the italian diaspora that would take italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands  by the late twentieth century chianti was often associated with basic chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket called a fiasco  however during the same period a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of doc regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of chianti these wines eventually became known as the super tuscans many of the producers behind the super tuscan movement were originally chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated doc regulations some of these producers wanted to make chiantis that were 100 varietal sangiovese others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending french grape varieties such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties the late twentieth century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern winemaking techniques such as the use of new oak barrels the prices and wine ratings of some super tuscans would regularly eclipse those of doc sanctioned chiantis the success of the super tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the doc regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as chianti the chianti region covers a vast area of tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping denominazione di origine controllata doc and denominazione di origine controllata e garantita docg regions  other well known sangiovesebased tuscan wines such as brunello di montalcino and vino nobile di montepulciano could be bottled and labeled under the most basic designation of chianti if their producers chose to do so  within the collective chianti region more than 8 million cases of wines classified as doc level or above are produced each year  today most chianti falls under two major designations of chianti docg which includes basic level chianti as well as that from seven designated subzones and chianti classico docg in 1716 cosimo iii de medici grand duke of tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the lega del chianti castellina in chianti gaiole in chianti and radda in chianti as well as the village of greve and a 2mile 3km stretch of hillside north of greve near spedaluzza as the only officially recognized producers of chianti this delineation existed until july 1932 when the italian government expanded the chianti zone to include the outlying areas of barberino val delsa chiocchio robbiano san casciano in val di pesa and strada the 1932 expansion was canonized into doc regulations in 1966  since the mid 1980s the chianti classico zone has had its own docg recognized area separate from the greater chianti region the chianti classico region covers an area of approximate 100 square miles 259 square kilometers between the city of florence to the north and siena to the south the four communes of castellina in chianti gaiole in chianti greve in chianti and radda in chianti are located entirely within the boundaries of the classico region with parts of barberino val delsa san casciano in val di pesa and tavarnelle val di pesa in the province of florence as well as castelnuovo berardenga and poggibonsi in the province of siena included within the permitted boundaries of chianti classico the soil and geography of this region can be quite varied with altitudes ranging from 820 feet 250 meters to 2000 feet 610 meters and rolling hills producing differing macroclimates  there are two main soil types in the region a weathered sandstone known as albarese and a bluishgray chalky marlstone known as galestro chianti classico wines tend to be mediumbodied with firm tannins and mediumhigh to high acidity  floral cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the midpalate and finish than at the front of the mouth  as with bordeaux the different regions of chianti classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas  according to master of wine mary ewingmulligan chianti classico wines from the castellina region tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavor castelnuovo berardegna region wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting wines from gaiole tend to have be characterized by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours the chianti docg covers all the chianti wine and includes a large stretch of land encompassing the western reaches of the province of pisa near the coast of the tyrrhenian sea the florentine hills in the province of florence to the north to the province of arezzo in the east and the siena hills to the south  within this regions are vineyards that overlap the docg regions of brunello di montalcino vino nobile di montepulciano and vernaccia di san gimignano any sangiovesebased wine made according to the chianti guideline from these vineyards can be labelled and marked under the basic chianti docg should the producer wish to use the designation within the chianti docg there are eight defined subzones that are permitted to affix their name to the wine label outside of chianto classico the wines of the chianti subzone of rufina are among the most widely recognized and exported from the chianti region  located in the arno valley near the town of pontassieve the rufina region includes much area in the pomino region an area that has a long history of wine production the area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to 2950 feet 900 meters the vineyard soils of the region are predominately marl and chalk the florentine merchant families of the antinori and frescobaldi own the majority of the vineyards in rufina chianti from the rufina area is characterized by its multilayered complexity and elegance the colli fiorentini has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries  many foreign flying winemakers have had a hand in this development bringing global viticulture and winemaking techniques to the colli fiorentini located in the hills between the chianti classico area and arno valley the wines of the colli fiorentini vary widely depending on producer but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes the montalbano region is located in the shadow of the carmignano docg with much of the best sangiovese going to that wine a similar situation exists in the colli senesi which includes the well known docg region of vino nobile di montepulciano both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of tuscany the colli pisane area produces typical chiantis with the lightest body and color the colli aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years since 1996 the blend for chianti and chianti classico has been 75100 sangiovese up to 10 canaiolo and up to 20 of any other approved red grape variety such as cabernet sauvignon merlot or syrah since 2006 the use of white grape varieties such as malvasia and trebbiano have been prohibited in chianti classico chianti classico must have a minimum alcohol level of at least 12 with a minimum of 7 months aging in oak while chianti classicos labeled riserva must be aged at least 27 months at the winery with a minimum alcohol level of at least 125 the aging for basic chianti docg is much less stringent with most varieties allowed to be released to the market on 1 march following the vintage year the subzones of colli fiorentini montespertoli and rufina must be aged for a further three months and not released until 1 june  all chianti classicos must be held back until 1 october in the year following the vintage jancis robinson notes that chianti is sometimes called the bordeaux of italy chianti classico wines are characterized in their youth by their predominantly floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet  as the wine ages aromas of tobacco and leather can emerge  chiantis tend to have mediumhigh acidity and medium tannins the acidity in the wines make them very flexible with food and wine pairings particularly with italian cuisines that feature red sauce as well with as beef lamb and wild game chianti superiore is an italian docg wine produced in the provinces of arezzo florence pisa pistoia prato and siena in tuscany superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other chianti wines  chianti superiore has been authorized since 1996  chianti superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the chianti classico subzone  vineyards registered in chianti subzones2 other than classico can produce chianti superiore wines but must omit the subzone name on the label  ageing is calculated from 1 january after the picking  chianti superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of ageing of which three must be in the bottle  therefore it cannot be bottled before the june after picking or sold to consumers before the next september chianti superiore wines must be produced with the following grapes the black rooster gallo nero in italian that appears on the neck labels of many chianti classico is the symbol of the consorzio chianti classico a foundation of producers in the chianti classico region the foundation was founded with the aim of promoting the wines of the region improving quality and preventing wine fraud  since the 1980s the foundation has sponsored extensive research into the viticultural and winemaking practice of the chianti classic area particularly in the area of clonal research  in the last quarter of a century more than 50 of the vineyards in the chianti classic region have been replanted with improved sangioves clones and to modern vineyard schematics as part of the consorzio chianti classicos project chianti 2000', 'centralpontinemyelinolysis it can also occur outside the pons the term osmotic demyelinization syndrome is similar to central pontine

of british 1970s punk with the raw energy of the 1980s american hardcore punk scene  dead kennedys songs mixed deliberately shocking lyrics with satirical and sarcastic criticism of social and political issues of the reagan era in the late 1980s the band was embroiled in an obscenity trial in the us over the artwork of their 1985 album frankenchrist which included the explicit titular subject of h r gigers penis landscape the band was charged with distribution of harmful matter to minors but the trial ended with a hung jury  dead kennedys released five studio albums before officially disbanding in 1986  in 2001 the band reformed without original singer jello biafra who had been in a legal dispute with the other members over royalties the band played three dates in october 2010  on one of the dates they debuted their first new song since 1986 youre such a fake since the dissolution of dead kennedys biafra has continued to collaborate and record with other artists including mojo nixon al jourgensen of ministry and the melvins and has gone on to be a spoken word performer covering political topics in particular dead kennedys formed in june 1978 when east bay ray raymond pepperell advertised for bandmates after seeing a skapunk show at the mabuhay gardens they were heavily influenced by the bands they saw there the original dk lineup consisted of jello biafra eric reed boucher on vocals east bay ray on guitar klaus flouride geoffrey lyall on bass and 6025 carlos cadona on drums  this lineup recorded their first demos  in early july the band wanted a more experienced drummer so they recruited ted bruce slesinger drummer 6025 left the band but he was invited back as second guitarist  their first show was on july 19 1978 at the mabuhay gardens in san francisco california dead kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterwards  due to the bands provocative name they sometimes played under pseudonyms including the sharks the creamsicles and the pink twinkies the name generated controversy  wrote san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen in 1978 just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir along comes a punk rock group called the dead kennedys which will play at mabuhay gardens on nov 22 the 15th anniversary of john f kennedys assassination  despite mounting protests the owner of mabuhay says i cant cancel them now  theres a contract  not apparently the kind of contract some people have in mind  however despite popular belief the name was not meant to insult the assassinated kennedy brothers but to quote biafra to bring attention to the end of the american dream 6025 left the band in march 1979  in june 1979 the band released their first single california ber alles on the alternative tentacles label they followed with a well received east coast tour the band who all wore white shirts with a big black s painted on the front pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign then started playing a new song pull my strings a barbed satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry which contained the lyrics is my cock big enough is my brain small enough for you to make me a star the song also referenced the knacks biggest new wave hit my sharona the song was never recorded in the studio but this performance the first and only time the song was ever performed was released on the compilation album give me convenience or give me death in early 1980 they recorded and released holiday in cambodia later that year the band released their debut album fresh fruit for rotting vegetables it reached 33 in the uk albums chart in january 1981 ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement he played his last concert in february  his replacement was dh peligro darren henley around the same time east bay ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign a major label deal with polydor records biafra claims he was prepared to quit the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign the deal though ray asserts that he recommended against signing with polydor polydor balked after they learned that the kennedys were planning their next single to be too drunk to fuck in may the band released the single too drunk to fuck the song caused much controversy in the uk as bbc feared the single would reach the top 30 this would require a mention of the song on top of the pops however this never came to be as the single peaked at 36 with peligros propulsive drums behind the band 1981s in god we trust inc ep saw them moving toward full on hardcorethrash  in addition to the eps controversial artwork depicting a gold christ figure on a cross of dollar bills the lyrics contained biafras most biting social and political commentary yet and songs such as moral majority nazi punks fuck off and weve got a bigger problem now put the dks on the map as the leaders of a social movement while dog bite a cover version of rawhide and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side the following year 1982 they released a full album plastic surgery disasters the albums cover features a withered starving african childs hand being held and dwarfed by a white mans hand  this picture won the world press photo award in 1980 and was taken in karamoja district in uganda by mike wells the bands music had evolved much in a short time moving away from hardcore formulas toward a more innovative jazzinformed style featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre  by now the group had become a defacto political force pitting itself against rising elements of american social and political life such as the religious right ronald reagan and the idle rich the band continued touring all over the united states as well as europe and australia and gained a large underground following  while they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984 they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the alternative tentacles record label which would become synonymous with diy alternative culture the band continued to write and perform new material during this time which would appear on their next album some of these early performances can be seen in the live at dmpos on broadway video originally released by dirk dirksen and later reissued on rhino the release of the album frankenchrist in 1985 showed the band had grown in terms of musical proficiency and lyrical maturity  while there were still a number of loudfast songs much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers  around this time klaus flouride released the similarly experimental solo ep cha cha cha with mr flouride lyrically the band continued their trademark social commentary with songs such as mtv get off the air and jockorama poking fun at mainstream america in some ways the album represented an artistic peak however the album also heralded in an era of prolonged legal trouble for the band the artwork caused a furor with the newly formed parents music resource center pmrc in december 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the wherehouse records store in los angeles county the girls mother wrote letters of complaint to the california attorney general and to los angeles prosecutors members of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the california penal code on a misdemeanor charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to 2000  biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home the prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material but judge susan isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics the charges against three of the original defendants ruth schwartz owner of mordam records steve boudreau a distributor involved in supplying frankenchrist to the los angeles wherehouse store and salvatore alberti owner of the factory where the record was pressed were dismissed for lack of evidence in august 1987 the criminal trial was submitted to the jury with the two remaining defendants  jello biafra and michael bonanno former alternative tentacles label manager the album however was banned from many record stores nationwide jello biafra brought up the court case after the breakup of the band on the oprah winfrey show biafra was on the show with tipper gore as part of a panel discussion on the issues of controversial music lyrics and censorship in addition to the obscenity lawsuit and being ignored by the mainstream media mtv and most radio stations gave such groups scant notice not to mention airplay the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground as well the hardcore scene which had been a haven for freethinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists was increasingly attracting hooligans who came to punk concerts looking only to slam dance and fight to violent music  in earlier years the band had criticized neonazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene but just as big a problem was the increasing popularity of thrash metal and stereotypical macho post1982 hardcore which brought the group and their genre an audience that had little to do with the ideasideals they stood for  in january 1986 frustrated and alienated from their own scene the dks decided to break up to pursue other interests and played their last concert on february 21  the band continued to work on songs with biafra penning songs such as chickenshit conformist and anarchy for sale which articulated their feelings about the dumbing down of punk rock during the summer they recorded these songs for their final album bedtime for democracy which was released in november the artwork depicting a defaced statue of liberty overrun with nazis media opportunists klan members corrupt government officials and religious zombies echoed the idea that the punk scene was no longer a safe haven for your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the album contains a number of fastshort songs interspersed with jazz dmso spoken word a commercial and psychedelia cesspools of eden the lyrical focus is more introspective and earnest where do ya draw the line with an antiwar antiviolence rambozo the clown bent moving away from the violent imagery of their early records while remaining as subversive as ever i spy dmso in december the band announced their split  biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of spokenword albums  ray flouride and peligro also went on to solo careers in the late 1990s former band members discovered problems with the amount of payments which each band member had received from their record label alternative tentacles former band members claimed that jello biafra had conspired to pay less royalty rates to the band members  although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake they were upset that biafra failed to inform the band of the mistake after he and his coworkers discovered it biafra claims that their lawyers had told him only to correspond through lawyers and not directly with the band as the conflict over payment had apparently arisen before the accounting mistake was discovered  both sides claim they attempted to resolve the matter without legal action but the ultimately complicated legal dispute involving royalties publishing rights and a number of other issues soon led to the courts where biafra was found liable for the royalties and guilty of fraud and malice and was ordered to pay damages of nearly 200000 including 20000 in punitive damages to the band members malice was defined for the jury as conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others  biafras appeal was denied he had to pay the outstanding royalties and punitive damages and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of dead kennedys back catalogue to the decay music partnership the jury and judges also noted in their words that biafra lacked credibility on the songwriting issue and found from evidence presented by both sides that the songwriting credits were due to the entire band using a clause in the bands written partnership giving a small share of every dead kennedys song royalty directly to the band partnership biafra had received sole songwriting credit for most dead kennedys songs on all released albums for the last 20 years or so without complaints from the band though a minority of songs had given credit to certain group members or the entire band as a whole indicating a system designed to reflect the primary composers rather than a regimented system like the jaggerrichards partnership today most kennedys reissues list the songwriters as biafra dead kennedys indicating biafras lyrical contributionswhich the band doesnt dispute or else simply as dead kennedys ray flouride and peligro found new distribution through another label manifesto records this dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause and the case caused minor waves within punk circles  biafra claims that guitarist east bay ray had long expressed displeasure with alternative tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments it was found out that alternative tentacles was paying dead kennedys less per cd than all the other bands including biafra himself and not informing his other bandmates which was the fraud  biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous dead kennedys song holiday in cambodia for use in a levis jeans commercial which the band denied biafra apparently pushed this issue in court although there was no hard evidence and the jurors were apparently unconcerned with corporate use of independently produced political music  biafra would later complain that the jury was not sympathetic toward underground music and punk culture the song never appeared in a levis commercial although in interviews biafra described the situation surrounding the commercial in detail and was able to give specifics about the advertisement including the name of the advertising agency that had created the commercials script biafras former bandmates maintain that they sued because of jello biafras deliberate withholding of money though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake but insist that biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly  details about this issue remain scarce the band also maintains that the levis story was completely fictitious and invented by biafra to discredit them  ultimately these issues have led to a souring of relationships with the erstwhile bandmates who still have not resolved their personal differences as of 2008 matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited jello biafra to bury the hatchet in the form of a band reunion  jello biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly  in addition biafra was disdainful of the reunion and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunionoldies tours in particular argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed  several dvds reissues and live albums have been released since the departure of biafra most recently on manifesto records according to biafra the live albums are cashins on dead kennedys name and his music  biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality  furthermore he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any manifesto records releases  consequently he has discouraged fans from buying any dead kennedy reissues the other band members denied biafras accusations regarding the live releases and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work  biafra dismissed the new group as the worlds greediest karaoke band  nevertheless in 2003 klaus flouride bassist for the band had this to say of performances without the bands former frontman  there hasnt been a show yet that people didnt really like biafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 80s incarnation of the band which he labeled as false advertising he recently attacked the reformed dead kennedys in a song called those dumb punk kids will buy anything which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the melvins sieg howdy biafra told an audience at a speaking gig in trenton new jersey that the remaining dead kennedys have licensed their single too drunk to fuck to be used in a rape scene in a robert rodriguez movie the reference is to a lounge cover of the song recorded by the band nouvelle vague played during a scene in the planet terror segment of grindhouse although no rape takes place and in fact the wouldbe rapist is killed by the wouldbe victim the scene in planet terror has wouldbe rapist rapist 1 quentin tarantino order onelegged stripper cherry darlin rose mcgowan to get up off the floor and dance  at this point tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and nouvelle vagues cover of too drunk to fuck plays jello clearly disapproving of the situation later wrote this is their lowest point since levis this goes against everything the dead kennedys stands for in spades the terrified woman later wins by killing tarantino but that excuse does not rescue this at all i wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for some people will do anything for money i cant help but think back to how prudish klaus flouride was when he objected to hr gigers painting on the frankenchrist sic poster saying he couldnt bear to show it to his parents  id sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter the deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired the reformed dead kennedys followed their court victory by announcing a number of tour dates releasing reissues of all dead kennedys albums except fresh fruit for rotting vegetables to which they did not have the rights until 2005 releasing several new archival concert dvds and licensing several songs to the manchurian candidate remake and the tony hawk pro skater video game  east bay ray claims he received a fax from alternative tentacles purporting biafra approved the licensing for the game which biafra denies happening the band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an anticorporate ideology despite performing on september 5 2003 at a festival in turkey that was sponsored by cocacola noting that they have since pulled out of a show in los angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by coors however biafra claims the above mentioned licensing deals prove otherwise some have found difficulty reconciling this claim when biafra also licensed to major corporations approving with the other band members use of dead kennedys songs in major studio film releases such as neighbors freddy got fingered and fear and loathing in las vegas in 2001 ray peligro and flouride chose former dr know singer brandon cruz to replace biafra on vocals the band played under name dk kennedys for a few concerts but later reverted to dead kennedys permanently they played across the continental united states europe asia south america and russia brandon cruz left the band in may 2003 and was replaced by jeff penalty the band has released two live albums of archival performances on manifesto records mutiny on the bay compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with biafra in 1986 and live at the deaf club a recording of a 1979 performance at the deaf club in san francisco which was greeted with more enthusiasm on october 9 2007 a bestof album entitled milking the sacred cow was released it includes two previously unreleased live versions of soup is good food and jockorama originally found on frankenchrist jeff penalty left the band in march 2008 in what he describes as a not amicable split he was replaced by former wynona riders singer ron skip greer  dh also left the band to take some personal time off he was replaced for a tour by translator drummer dave scheff on august 21 2008 the band announced an extended break from touring due to the healthrelated issues of flouride and peligro they stated their plans to collaborate on new projects the band performed a gig in santa rosa california in june 2009 with peligro returning to the drum kit in august 2010 the dead kennedys announced plans for a short east coast tour   this lineup assembled for this tour contained east bay ray peligro greer and bassist greg reeves replacing flouride who was taking personal time off from the band the tour dates will include performances in philadelphia new york city boston washington dc portland maine and hawaii the dead kennedys performed what appears to be their first new song in 24 years youre such a fake during their october 16 2010 concert at the rock and roll hotel in washington dc in addition the band played a reworked version of the old song mtv get off the air now retitled mp3 get off the web with lyrics that were changed to be about people downloading mp3s and how much they suck for doing it dead kennedys are noted for the harshness of their lyrics which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly leftwing view of contemporary america unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering dead kennedys lyrics are often snide  holiday in cambodia is a multilayered satire targeting both the liberal elite and cambodias thencurrent khmer rouge regime', 'economyofdenmark with very few natural resources the mixed economy of denmark relies almost

average of 23 a year in 2004 2005 and 2006 recently being revised upward from an average of just 09 and previously with a too high employment level estimated the upward revision is good because a high
